gerard_ryle_how_the_panama_papers_journalists_broke_the_biggest_leak_in_history	"What do you do if you had to figure out the information behind 11.5 million documents, verify it and make sense of it? That was a challenge that a group of journalists had to face late last year. An anonymous person calling himself John Doe had somehow managed to copy nearly 40 years of records of the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. This is one of many firms around the world that specialize in setting up accounts in offshore tax havens like the British Virgin Islands, for rich and powerful people who like to keep secrets. John Doe had managed to copy every spreadsheet from this firm, every client file, every email, from 1977 to the present day. It represented the biggest cache of inside information into the tax haven system that anyone had ever seen. But it also presented a gigantic challenge to investigative journalism. Think about it: 11.5 million documents, containing the secrets of people from more than 200 different countries. Where do you start with such a vast resource? Where do you even begin to tell a story that can trail off into every corner of the globe, and that can affect almost any person in any language, sometimes in ways they don't even know yet. John Doe had given the information to two journalists at the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. He said he was motivated by — and I quote — ""The scale of the injustice that the documents would reveal."" But one user alone can never make sense of such a vast amount of information. So the Süddeutsche Zeitung reached out to my organization in Washington, DC, The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. We decided to do something that was the very opposite of everything we'd been taught to do as journalists: share. (Laughter) By nature, investigative reporters are lone wolves. We fiercely guard our secrets, at times even from our editors, because we know that the moment we tell them what we have, they'll want that story right away. And to be frank, when you get a good story, you like to keep the glory to yourself. But there's no doubt that we live in a shrinking world, and that the media has largely been slow to wake up to this. The issues we report on are more and more transnational. Giant corporations operate on a global level. Environmental and health crises are global. So, too, are financial flows and financial crises. So it seems staggering that journalism has been so late to cover stories in a truly global way. And it also seems staggering that journalism has been so slow to wake up to the possibilities that technology brings, rather than being frightened of it. The reason journalists are scared of technology is this: the profession's largest institutions are going through tough times because of the changing way that people are consuming news. The advertising business models that have sustained reporting are broken. And this has plunged journalism into crisis, forcing those institutions to reexamine how they function. But where there is crisis, there is also opportunity. The first challenge presented by what would eventually become known as the Panama Papers was to make the documents searchable and readable. There were nearly five million emails, two million PDFs that needed to be scanned and indexed, and millions more files and other kinds of documents. They all needed to be housed in a safe and secure location in the cloud. We next invited reporters to have a look at the documents. In all, reporters from more than 100 media organizations in 76 countries — from the BBC in Britain to Le Monde newspaper in France to the Asahi Shimbun in Japan. ""Native eyes on native names,"" we called it, the idea being, who best to tell you who was important to Nigeria than a Nigerian journalist? Who best in Canada than a Canadian? There were only two rules for everyone who was invited: we all agreed to share everything that we found with everybody else, and we all agreed to publish together on the same day. We chose our media partners based on trust that had been built up through previous smaller collaborations and also from leads that jumped out from the documents. Over the next few months, my small nonprofit organization of less than 20 people was joined by more than 350 other reporters from 25 language groups. The biggest information leak in history had now spawned the biggest journalism collaboration in history: 376 sets of native eyes doing what journalists normally never do, working shoulder to shoulder, sharing information, but telling no one. For it became clear at this point that in order to make the biggest kind of noise, we first needed the biggest kind of silence. To manage the project over the many months it would take, we built a secure virtual newsroom. We used encrypted communication systems, and we built a specially designed search engine. Inside the virtual newsroom, the reporters could gather around the themes that were emerging from the documents. Those interested in blood diamonds or exotic art, for instance, could share information about how the offshore world was being used to hide the trade in both of those commodities. Those interested in sport could share information about how famous sports stars were putting their image rights into offshore companies, thereby likely avoiding taxes in the countries where they plied their trade. But perhaps most exciting of all were the number of world leaders and elect politicians that were emerging from the documents — figures like Petro Poroshenko in Ukraine, close associates of Vladimir Putin in Russia and the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, who is linked through his late father, Ian Cameron. Buried in the documents were secret offshore entities, such as Wintris Inc., a company in the British Virgin Islands that had actually belonged to the sitting Icelandic prime minister. I like to refer to Johannes Kristjansson, the Icelandic reporter we invited to join the project, as the loneliest man in the world. For nine months, he refused paid work and lived off the earnings of his wife. He pasted tarps over the windows of his home to prevent prying eyes during the long Icelandic winter. And he soon ran out of excuses to explain his many absences, as he worked red-eyed, night after night, month after month. In all that time, he sat on information that would eventually bring down the leader of his country. Now, when you're an investigative reporter and you make an amazing discovery, such as your prime minster can be linked to a secret offshore company, that that company has a financial interest in Icelandic banks — the very issue he's been elected on — well, your instinct is to scream out very loud. Instead, as one of the few people that he could speak to, Johannes and I shared a kind of gallows humor. ""Wintris is coming,"" he used to say. (Laughter) (Applause) We were big fans of ""Game of Thrones."" When reporters like Johannes wanted to scream, they did so inside the virtual newsroom, and then they turned those screams into stories by going outside the documents to court records, official company registers, and by eventually putting questions to those that we intended to name. Panama Papers actually allowed the reporters to look at the world through a different lens from everybody else. As we were researching the story, unconnected to us, a major political bribery scandal happened in Brazil. A new leader was elected in Argentina. The FBI began to indict officials at FIFA, the organization that controls the world of professional soccer. The Panama Papers actually had unique insights into each one of these unfolding events. So you can imagine the pressure and the ego dramas that could have ruined what we were trying to do. Any of one of these journalists, they could have broken the pact. But they didn't. And on April 3 this year, at exactly 8pm German time, we published simultaneously in 76 countries. (Applause) The Panama Papers quickly became one of the biggest stories of the year. This is the scene in Iceland the day after we published. It was the first of many protests. The Icelandic prime minister had to resign. It was a first of many resignations. We spotlighted many famous people such as Lionel Messi, the most famous soccer player in the world. And there were some unintended consequences. These alleged members of a Mexican drug cartel were arrested after we published details about their hideout. They'd been using the address to register their offshore company. (Laughter) There's a kind of irony in what we've been able to do. The technology — the Internet — that has broken the business model is allowing us to reinvent journalism itself. And this dynamic is producing unprecedented levels of transparency and impact. We showed how a group of journalists can effect change across the world by applying new methods and old-fashioned journalism techniques to vast amounts of leaked information. We put all-important context around what was given to us by John Doe. And by sharing resources, we were able to dig deep — much deeper and longer than most media organizations allow these days, because of financial concerns. Now, it was a big risk, and it wouldn't work for every story, but we showed with the Panama Papers that you can write about any country from just about anywhere, and then choose your preferred battleground to defend your work. Try obtaining a court injunction that would prevent the telling of a story in 76 different countries. Try stopping the inevitable. Shortly after we published, I got a three-word text from Johannes: ""Wintris has arrived."" (Laughter) It had arrived and so, too, perhaps has a new era for journalism. Thank you. (Applause) Bruno Giussani: Gerard, thank you. I guess you're going to send that applause to the 350 journalists who worked with you, right? Now, a couple of questions I would like to ask. The first one is, you'd been working in secrecy for over a year with 350-something colleagues from all over the world — was there ever a moment when you thought that the leak may be leaked, that the collaboration may just be broken by somebody publishing a story? Or somebody not in the group releasing some information that they got to know? Gerard Ryle: We had a series of crises along the way, including when something major was happening in the world, the journalists from that country wanted to publish right away. We had to calm them down. Probably the biggest crisis we had was a week before publication. We'd sent a series of questions to the associates of Vladimir Putin, but instead of responding, the Kremlin actually held a press conference and denounced us, and denounced the whole thing as being, I guess, a plot from the West. At that point, Putin thought it was just about him. And, of course, a lot of editors around the world were very nervous about this. They thought the story was going to get out. You can imagine the amount of time they'd spent, the amount of resources, money spent on this. So I had to basically spend the last week calming everyone down, a bit like a general, where you're holding your troops back: ""Calm, remain calm."" And then eventually, of course, they all did. BG: And then a couple weeks ago or so, you released a lot of the documents as an open database for everybody to search via keyword, essentially. GR: We very much believe that the basic information about the offshore world should be made public. Now, we didn't publish the underlying documents of the journalists we're working with. But the basic information such as the name of a person, what their offshore company was and the name of that company, is now all available online. In fact, the biggest resource of its kind basically is out there now BG: Gerard, thank you for the work you do. GR: Thank you. (Applause)"	如果你必須找出 1150 萬筆文件背後的資訊，並去判定、理解這些資訊時你會怎麼做？這是去年，很多記者不得不面對的挑戰。一名自稱「張三」的匿名者設法成功拷貝了巴拿馬律師事務所莫薩克・馮賽卡將近 40 年的文件這是世界上其中一間專門在海外避稅天堂比如，英屬維爾京群島這種地方幫客戶建立銀行帳戶的公司之一，他們為這些想要隱藏秘密的權貴者提供了這樣的管道。 張三設法從這家公司拷貝了每一張電子表格、每一份客戶檔案、每一封電子郵件、時間從 1977 年至今這是史上最大避稅天堂系統的資訊洩密案。但它也為新聞調查帶來了巨大挑戰想像一下： 1150 萬文件其中包含著來自 200 多個不同國家的秘密面對這麼大的資源要從何下手？你要從何開始進行新聞報導並追根究底到世上的每個角落？進而影響世上每一個人來關注這件事，我們的方式可能是他們從未見過的。 張三把信息給了德國《南德日報》的兩位記者，他說他的動機是——我引用一下——「這些文件能揭示這世上不公正的規模有多大」但是一個機構不可能憑一己之力理解如此大量的信息，所以《南德日報》聯繫了我位於美國華盛頓特區的機構「國際調查記者同盟」，我們決定要做一些不同於以往記者被教導的辦事方法，「分享」 （笑聲） 記者的天性就像孤狼，我們兇猛地捍衛著我們的機密有時候甚至不讓編輯知道，因為我們知道一旦告訴他們我們手頭的報導他們立刻就會想把報導佔為己有老實說，當你有了一篇精彩的新聞報導你會想獨享這份榮耀， 毫無疑問，我們正生活在一個日漸緊密的世界，但媒體業卻很晚才體認到這一點。我們報導的事件越來越跨國界。大型公司的跨國經營、環境和健康問題都是全球性的挑戰。同理，資金流動和經濟危機也是如此。所以，新聞界這麼晚才進行全球化報導的確令人驚訝，同樣令人驚訝的是新聞業竟這麼晚才體認到科技所帶來的可能性，而不是害怕科技。記者這麼害怕科技的原因是：這個最大的專業機構正在經歷困難時期，因為人們閱讀新聞的方式已經改變，支持新聞業的廣告商業模式已經瓦解。這使新聞業陷入困境，迫使這些機構反思他們如何運作， 但有危必有機，第一個挑戰是最終要如何把這份知名的巴拿馬文件變得可被搜索和可被閱讀。這裡有將近五百萬封電子郵件，兩百萬份需要被掃描和索引的電子文件還有成百萬的文件夾和其他類型的文件。他們都需要被存放在一個安全又保密的雲端。我們接下來，邀請全球的記者來看這些文件，總共有 76 個國家，超過 100 個媒體機構的記者參與。有來自英國廣播公司的、法國世界報的、日本朝日新聞。我們把這方法稱為《用本地人的眼睛來辨識本地人的名字》誰能比奈吉利亞的記者更能辨認出奈吉利亞的重要人物？誰能比加拿大記者更能說明加拿大的情況呢？被邀請來的記者只要遵守兩個規則：一是我們都同意分享我們和別人找到的任何信息，二是我們都同意在同一天發表結果， 我們用信任基礎，來篩選媒體夥伴，這信任可能是來自於之前的合作，也來自於在文件中發現的線索。後來的幾個月，我這邊不到 20 人的非營利組織加入了來自 25 種語言區超過 350 名的記者。有史以來最大的信息洩漏也催生了有史以來最大的新聞業合作376 名記者做著他們平常不會做的事情，並肩作戰分享信息，但是不能對外公佈。因為這時我們都清楚要造成最大程度的轟動我們必須先保持最大程度的肅靜。 這個項目預期要進行幾個月，我們建造了安全的虛擬新聞編輯室，我們使用加密的溝通系統，我們特地設計了一個專用的搜索引擎。在這虛擬新聞編輯室裏面，記者可以根據主題搜集文件中出現的信息。比如對血鑽石或者東方古董感興趣的人，可以分享這些人是如何利用境外世界來暗中進行商品的交易。對體育感興趣的人，可以分享體育明星們是如何把自己的肖像權讓海外公司使用，從而在他們所在的國家中避稅。 但也許其中最激動人心的是文件中出現的世界領袖和民選政治人物。比如烏克蘭的波羅申科、俄羅斯的普京的親信、和英國首相大衛 · 卡梅隆，他已故的父親伊恩 · 卡梅隆出現在文件中。 文件裏還藏著秘密的海外實體公司比如 Wintris 公司，它在英屬維爾京群島建立，實際上這家公司是當時冰島總理的公司。其中功不可沒的是約翰內斯 · 克里斯詹森，他是受我們邀請加入這項目的冰島記者，可以被稱為這世界上最孤獨的人。九個月以來，他拒接有酬勞的工作，依靠妻子的收入生活。在冰島漫長的冬天他在自己家中的窗戶上粘貼防水膠布，防止被窺探。不久他就用完了所有他長時間缺勤的藉口。他工作到眼睛充滿血絲，日復一日，月復一月長久以來，他掌握著足以使他的國家領導人下台的資訊。 現在，想像你是一位記者你正在進行驚人的調查，比如發現了總理和秘密海外公司有關係，那間公司在冰島銀行獲得了巨額的經濟利益，而這正是他被選上的原因，你肯定想大聲宣佈。但是，作為能與他交談的少數幾個人之一我和約翰內斯都有一種共同的黑色幽默，他曾經說，「Wintris要來了」（相關語:凜冬將至） （笑聲） （掌聲） 我們都是《權力遊戲》 的忠實粉絲。 當像約翰內斯這樣的記者想要大聲吶喊時，他們會在虛擬新聞編輯室中這樣做，接著他們把這些呐喊轉變成新聞報導，從文件的信息查到法庭記錄查到官方的公司註冊信息最後向我們的目標人物提出質問。巴拿馬文件實際上讓記者用不同於一般人的角度去觀察世界。 當我們在進行新聞調查的時候有的新聞和我們無關，巴西發生了重大的政治賄賂醜聞，阿根廷投票產生了新的領導，美國聯邦調查局開始起訴國際足球聯合會的官員，FIFA是控制世界職業足球比賽的組織。巴拿馬文件實際上對每件揭露的事都有著獨特的洞察力。所以你可以想像我們承受著足以摧毀我們事業的壓力和自負。團隊中的每一個記者，都有可能違反協議，但他們並沒有這樣做。今年的 4 月 3 日在德國時間的下午八點整我們在 76 個國家同時發佈了新聞。 （掌聲） 巴拿馬文件很快成為了今年最轟動的事件之一。這是我們發表後隔天在冰島的景象，這是眾多抗議遊行的開端；冰島的總理不得不辭職，這也是眾多領導下台的開端。我們關注許多名人比如萊昂內爾·梅西，他是全世界最著名的足球運動員。也有一些我們沒有預料到的後果：這些墨西哥販毒集團的成員被捕了因為我們公佈了他們巢穴的具體信息，他們一直用同一個地址來註冊他們的海外公司。 （笑聲） 我們做的事情也有諷刺的一面科技、網路這些曾經破壞了新聞商業模式的東西正在幫助我們重塑新聞業。這樣的改變已經正在進行前所未有的透明度和影響力。我們這一群記者向世人展示了我們將如何影響並改變全世界，藉由應用新方法和傳統新聞技巧的結合來擴大資訊披露的數量。我們把「匿名者」提供的重要內容放在一起。透過資源共享，我們能挖得更深——比現在的大多數媒體機構能挖得更深更久，因為他們有財務上的考量。 現在，這是一個重大挑戰，它不一定在每一個新聞報導中都起積極作用，但我們透過巴拿馬文件向世人展示不論你在哪裡都能報導任何國家的新聞，還能選擇你最感興趣的領域進行報導，嘗試去獲得法庭的禁令這樣可以避免來自 76 國家新聞報導的洩漏，嘗試阻止不可避免的事。 在我們發佈後不久我收到了約翰內斯的短信：「凜冬已至」 （笑聲） 也許新聞業的新時代也已經來臨了。 謝謝 （掌聲） 布魯諾 · 朱薩尼：傑拉德，謝謝你。 我想你會把這些掌聲送給和你並肩作戰的350 名記者，對吧。 現在，我想問幾個問題：第一個是你曾經和 350 多個來自世界各地的同事秘密工作超過了一年，有沒有一個時刻你覺得巴拿馬文件的報導已經被洩漏了，合作關係已經破壞了，因為有人擅自發佈了新聞，或者有不在組織內的某個人泄露了消息因為他們早就知道了？ 傑拉德 · 賴爾：我們一路以來都有一系列的危機，包括世界上某些重大事件發生時，這些國家的記者都想要立刻披露新聞，但我們必須讓他們冷靜下來。也許我們最重大的危機是在發佈前的一週，我們給普京的聯繫人發出了一系列的質問，他們沒有回覆，克林姆林宮反而召開了新聞發佈會並譴責我們，譴責整個事件是西方的陰謀。當時普京以為這只是針對他的。當然了，全世界的編輯都十分緊張，他們以為這個新聞就要被搶先公佈了。你可以想想他們為此花費的時間、精力和金錢。所以我在最後一週必須讓每個人冷靜下來。這有點像將軍在帶兵作戰，當你要全力攻擊時，你會向軍隊說 ，「冷靜，保持冷靜 」當然，最後大家都做到了。 布魯諾 · 朱薩尼：幾個星期前，你把很多文件發表在公開數據庫，所以任何人都可以通過關鍵詞進行查找。 傑拉德 · 賴爾：我們深信這些離岸世界的基本信息都應該公諸於世。現在，我們並不是公佈那些與我們合作的記者找出的深層信息，而只是公佈基本信息，比如人名、他們的海外公司在做什麼和公司名字，這些都應該能在網上找到。事實上，這些大型資源現在都公佈在網路上。 布魯諾 · 朱薩尼：傑拉德，謝謝你所有的努力。 傑拉德 · 賴爾：謝謝。 （掌聲）
