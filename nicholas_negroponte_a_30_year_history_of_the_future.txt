nicholas_negroponte_a_30_year_history_of_the_future	"(Video) Nicholas Negroponte:  Can we switch to the video disc, which is in play mode? I'm really interested in how you put people and computers together. We will be using the TV screens or their equivalents for electronic books of the future. (Music, crosstalk) Very interested in touch-sensitive displays, high-tech, high-touch, not having to pick up your fingers to use them. There is another way where computers touch people: wearing, physically wearing. Suddenly on September 11th, the world got bigger. NN: Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. When I was asked to do this, I was also asked to look at all 14 TED Talks that I had given, chronologically. The first one was actually two hours. The second one was an hour, and then they became half hours, and all I noticed was my bald spot getting bigger. (Laughter) Imagine seeing your life, 30 years of it, go by, and it was, to say the least, for me, quite a shocking experience. So what I'm going to do in my time is try and share with you what happened during the 30 years, and then also make a prediction, and then tell you a little bit about what I'm doing next. And I put on a slide where TED 1 happened in my life. And it's rather important because I had done 15 years of research before it, so I had a backlog, so it was easy. It's not that I was Fidel Castro and I could talk for two hours, or Bucky Fuller. I had 15 years of stuff, and the Media Lab was about to start. So that was easy. But there are a couple of things about that period and about what happened that are really quite important. One is that it was a period when computers weren't yet for people. And the other thing that sort of happened during that time is that we were considered sissy computer scientists. We weren't considered the real thing. So what I'm going to show you is, in retrospect, a lot more interesting and a lot more accepted than it was at the time. So I'm going to characterize the years and I'm even going to go back to some very early work of mine, and this was the kind of stuff I was doing in the '60s: very direct manipulation, very influenced as I studied architecture by the architect Moshe Safdie, and you can see that we even built robotic things that could build habitat-like structures. And this for me was not yet the Media Lab, but was the beginning of what I'll call sensory computing, and I pick fingers partly because everybody thought it was ridiculous. Papers were published about how stupid it was to use fingers. Three reasons: One was they were low-resolution. The other is your hand would occlude what you wanted to see, and the third, which was the winner, was that your fingers would get the screen dirty, and hence, fingers would never be a device that you'd use. And this was a device we built in the '70s, which has never even been picked up. It's not just touch sensitive, it's pressure sensitive. (Video) Voice: Put a yellow circle there. NN: Later work, and again this was before TED 1 — (Video) Voice: Move that west of the diamond. Create a large green circle there. Man: Aw, shit. NN: — was to sort of do interface concurrently, so when you talked and you pointed and you had, if you will, multiple channels. Entebbe happened. 1976, Air France was hijacked, taken to Entebbe, and the Israelis not only did an extraordinary rescue, they did it partly because they had practiced on a physical model of the airport, because they had built the airport, so they built a model in the desert, and when they arrived at Entebbe, they knew where to go because they had actually been there. The U.S. government asked some of us, '76, if we could replicate that computationally, and of course somebody like myself says yes. Immediately, you get a contract, Department of Defense, and we built this truck and this rig. We did sort of a simulation, because you had video discs, and again, this is '76. And then many years later, you get this truck, and so you have Google Maps. Still people thought, no, that was not serious computer science, and it was a man named Jerry Wiesner, who happened to be the president of MIT, who did think it was computer science. And one of the keys for anybody who wants to start something in life: Make sure your president is part of it. So when I was doing the Media Lab, it was like having a gorilla in the front seat. If you were stopped for speeding and the officer looked in the window and saw who was in the passenger seat, then, ""Oh, continue on, sir."" And so we were able, and this is a cute, actually, device, parenthetically. This was a lenticular photograph of Jerry Wiesner where the only thing that changed in the photograph were the lips. So when you oscillated that little piece of lenticular sheet with his photograph, it would be in lip sync with zero bandwidth. It was a zero-bandwidth teleconferencing system at the time. So this was the Media Lab's — this is what we said we'd do, that the world of computers, publishing, and so on would come together. Again, not generally accepted, but very much part of TED in the early days. And this is really where we were headed. And that created the Media Lab. One of the things about age is that I can tell you with great confidence, I've been to the future. I've been there, actually, many times. And the reason I say that is, how many times in my life have I said, ""Oh, in 10 years, this will happen,"" and then 10 years comes. And then you say, ""Oh, in five years, this will happen."" And then five years comes. So I say this a little bit with having felt that I'd been there a number of times, and one of the things that is most quoted that I've ever said is that computing is not about computers, and that didn't quite get enough traction, and then it started to. It started to because people caught on that the medium wasn't the message. And the reason I show this car in actually a rather ugly slide is just again to tell you the kind of story that characterized a little bit of my life. This is a student of mine who had done a Ph.D. called ""Backseat Driver."" It was in the early days of GPS, the car knew where it was, and it would give audio instructions to the driver, when to turn right,  when to turn left and so on. Turns out, there are a lot of things in those instructions that back in that period were pretty challenging, like what does it mean, take the next right? Well, if you're coming up on a street, the next right's probably the one after, and there are lots of issues, and the student did a wonderful thesis, and the MIT patent office said ""Don't patent it. It'll never be accepted. The liabilities are too large. There will be insurance issues. Don't patent it."" So we didn't, but it shows you how people, again, at times, don't really look at what's happening. Some work, and I'll just go through these very quickly, a lot of sensory stuff. You might recognize a young Yo-Yo Ma and tracking his body for playing the cello or the hypercello. These fellows literally walked  around like that at the time. It's now a little bit more discreet and more commonplace. And then there are at least three heroes I want to quickly mention. Marvin Minsky, who taught me a lot about common sense, and I will talk briefly about Muriel Cooper, who was very important to Ricky Wurman and to TED, and in fact, when she got onstage, she said, the first thing she said was, ""I introduced Ricky to Nicky."" And nobody calls me Nicky and nobody calls Richard Ricky, so nobody knew who she was talking about. And then, of course, Seymour Papert, who is the person who said, ""You can't think about thinking unless you think about thinking about something."" And that's actually — you can unpack that later. It's a pretty profound statement. I'm showing some slides that were from TED 2, a little silly as slides, perhaps. Then I felt television really was about displays. Again, now we're past TED 1, but just around the time of TED 2, and what I'd like to mention here is, even though you could imagine intelligence in the device, I look today at some of the work being done about the Internet of Things, and I think it's kind of tragically pathetic, because what has happened is people take the oven panel and put it on your cell phone, or the door key onto your cell phone, just taking it and bringing it to you, and in fact that's actually what you don't want. You want to put a chicken in the oven, and the oven says, ""Aha, it's a chicken,"" and it cooks the chicken. ""Oh, it's cooking the chicken for Nicholas, and he likes it this way and that way."" So the intelligence, instead of being in the device, we have started today to move it back onto the cell phone or closer to the user, not a particularly enlightened view of the Internet of Things. Television, again, television what I said today, that was back in 1990, and the television of tomorrow would look something like that. Again, people, but they laughed cynically, they didn't laugh with much appreciation. Telecommunications in the 1990s, George Gilder decided that he would call this diagram the Negroponte switch. I'm probably much less famous than George, so when he called it the Negroponte switch, it stuck, but the idea of things that came in the ground would go in the air and stuff in the air would go into the ground has played itself out. That is the original slide from that year, and it has worked in lockstep obedience. We started Wired magazine. Some people, I remember we shared the reception desk periodically, and some parent called up irate that his son had given up Sports Illustrated to subscribe for Wired, and he said, ""Are you some porno magazine or something?"" and couldn't understand why his son would be interested in Wired, at any rate. I will go through this a little quicker. This is my favorite, 1995, back page of Newsweek magazine. Okay. Read it. (Laughter) [""Nicholas Negroponte, director of the MIT Media Lab, predicts that we'll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Internet. Uh, sure."" —Clifford Stoll, Newsweek, 1995] You must admit that gives you, at least it gives me pleasure when somebody says how dead wrong you are. ""Being Digital"" came out. For me, it gave me an opportunity to be more in the trade press and get this out to the public, and it also allowed us to build the new Media Lab, which if you haven't been to, visit, because it's a beautiful piece of architecture aside from being a wonderful place to work. So these are the things we were saying in those TEDs. [Today, multimedia is a desktop or living room experience, because the apparatus is so clunky. This will change dramatically with small, bright, thin, high-resolution displays. — 1995] We came to them. I looked forward to it every year. It was the party that Ricky Wurman never had in the sense that he invited many of his old friends, including myself. And then something for me changed pretty profoundly. I became more involved with computers and learning and influenced by Seymour, but particularly looking at learning as something that is best approximated by computer programming. When you write a computer program, you've got to not just list things out and sort of take an algorithm and translate it into a set of instructions, but when there's a bug, and all programs have bugs, you've got to de-bug it. You've got to go in, change it, and then re-execute, and you iterate, and that iteration is really a very, very good approximation of learning. So that led to my own work with Seymour in places like Cambodia and the starting of One Laptop per Child. Enough TED Talks on One Laptop per Child, so I'll go through it very fast, but it did give us the chance to do something at a relatively large scale in the area of learning, development and computing. Very few people know that One Laptop per Child was a $1 billion project, and it was, at least over the seven years I ran it, but even more important, the World Bank contributed zero, USAID zero. It was mostly the countries using their own treasuries, which is very interesting, at least to me it was very interesting in terms of what I plan to do next. So these are the various places it happened. I then tried an experiment, and the experiment happened in Ethiopia. And here's the experiment. The experiment is, can learning happen where there are no schools. And we dropped off tablets with no instructions and let the children figure it out. And in a short period of time, they not only turned them on and were using 50 apps per child within five days, they were singing ""ABC"" songs within two weeks, but they hacked Android within six months. And so that seemed sufficiently interesting. This is perhaps the best picture I have. The kid on your right has sort of nominated himself as teacher. Look at the kid on the left, and so on. There are no adults involved in this at all. So I said, well can we do this at a larger scale? And what is it that's missing? The kids are giving a press conference at this point, and sort of writing in the dirt. And the answer is, what is missing? And I'm going to skip over my prediction, actually, because I'm running out of time, and here's the question, is what's going to happen? I think the challenge is to connect the last billion people, and connecting the last billion is very different than connecting the next billion, and the reason it's different is that the next billion are sort of low-hanging fruit, but the last billion are rural. Being rural and being poor are very different. Poverty tends to be created by our society, and the people in that community are not poor in the same way at all. They may be primitive, but the way to approach it and to connect them, the history of One Laptop per Child, and the experiment in Ethiopia, lead me to believe that we can in fact do this in a very short period of time. And so my plan, and unfortunately I haven't been able to get my partners at this point to let me announce them, but is to do this with a stationary satellite. There are many reasons that stationary satellites aren't the best things, but there are a lot of reasons why they are, and for two billion dollars, you can connect a lot more than 100 million people, but the reason I picked two, and I will leave this as my last slide, is two billion dollars is what we were spending in Afghanistan every week. So surely if we can connect Africa and the last billion people for numbers like that, we should be doing it. Thank you very much. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Stay up there. Stay up there. NN: You're going to give me extra time? CA: No. That was wickedly clever, wickedly clever. You gamed it beautifully. Nicholas, what is your prediction? (Laughter) NN: Thank you for asking. I'll tell you what my prediction is, and my prediction, and this is a prediction, because it'll be 30 years. I won't be here. But one of the things about learning how to read, we have been doing a lot of consuming of information going through our eyes, and so that may be a very inefficient channel. So my prediction is that we are  going to ingest information You're going to swallow a pill and know English. You're going to swallow a pill and know Shakespeare. And the way to do it is through the bloodstream. So once it's in your bloodstream, it basically goes through it and gets into the brain, and when it knows that it's in the brain in the different pieces, it deposits it in the right places. So it's ingesting. CA: Have you been hanging out with Ray Kurzweil by any chance? NN: No, but I've been hanging around with Ed Boyden and hanging around with one of the speakers who is here, Hugh Herr, and there are a number of people. This isn't quite as far-fetched, so 30 years from now. CA: We will check it out. We're going to be back and we're going to play this clip 30 years from now, and then all eat the red pill. Well thank you for that. Nicholas Negroponte. NN: Thank you. (Applause)"	"（影片）尼可拉斯·尼葛洛龐帝：勞駕幫我播放下錄影帶。 我對人機對話模式情有獨鍾。將來，人們會使用電視螢幕或類似設備來閱讀電子書。（音樂，串聲）我對觸控式螢幕深感興趣。高科技，高觸感，指尖操控。另一種人機互動的方式是把電腦像衣服那樣穿在身上。突然，在9月11號這一天，眼前的世界豁然開闊。 尼可拉斯·尼葛洛龐帝: 謝謝（掌聲） 謝謝。 我受邀參加這次TED演講時，他們讓我重新回顧了我在不同年代先後發表的14次TED演講。第一次實際講了2小時，第二次1小時，之後時間縮短到半小時。我發現每來一次TED，我的頭髮就掉了不少。（笑聲）暮然回首，30年的人生，就這樣悄然流逝。至少對我來講，這太不可思議了。所以這次重回TED講臺，我會盡我所能，與大家分享這30年裡發生的事情。接著，我還會再做一次預測，然後告訴你們我接下來的工作計畫。這張幻燈片總結了我第一次TED演講的主要內容。那次演講相當重要，因為在此之前，我做了15年的潛心研究。所以我有備而來，輕裝上陣。我不是菲德爾·卡斯楚（古巴領導人），可以滔滔不絕地講2個小時，也沒有布基·富勒（新未來主義建築師）的遠見卓識，但我有15年的知識積累，當時正在籌建媒體實驗室，所以那次演講毫不費力。 不過，關於那個年代，還有當時發生的事情，有幾點非常重要。第一點是那個年代的電腦不是為人而開發的。另一點在當時比較盛行，我們被認為是無用的電腦科學家。沒人拿我們當回事。所以，回想過去的經歷，我接下來展示的內容比當時更有趣，更廣為接受。 我要概括一下這些年的經歷，甚至回過頭來重新審視一些非常早期的研究工作。這是我在上世紀60年代研究的裝置，直接點擊操作，就像我在學習建築的時候一樣，我從建築師薩夫迪的理念中吸取了靈感。你可以看到我們甚至建造了機器人裝置，它們能夠搭建“棲息地式”結構。對於我來講，這還不是媒體實驗室，而是我要稱之為“感覺計算”的雛形。我之所以想到用手指來操控，部分是因為每個人都覺得這個想法很荒謬。當時發表了很多文章，指出手指操作有多愚蠢。他們列舉了三個原因，首先是解析度低。其次，手會遮擋視線，讓你看不到細節。最後，他們使出的“殺手鐧”是手指會弄髒螢幕。所以，手指絕對不會成為操作設備。這台裝置誕生於上世紀70年代，當時甚至無人問津。它不僅觸覺敏感，而且壓力敏感。 （影片）聲音：在那兒畫一個黃色圓圈。 尼可拉斯·尼葛洛龐帝:這是後期的工作，同樣發生在 TED 1 之前—— （影片）聲音：把它移動到菱形的西面。在那兒畫一個綠色的大圓圈。影片中的人：喔，該死！ 尼可拉斯·尼葛洛龐帝:——這是在進行同步交互。一邊說話，一邊用手比劃。只要你願意，還可以有多種交互管道。 後來發生了恩德培劫機事件。1976年，一架法航客機被劫持到恩德培。以色列人完成了出色的營救行動。他们成功的部分原因是利用了機場的物理模型，進行過解救人質演練。因為機場是他們修建的，所以他們在沙漠中製作了一個模型。在到達恩德培之後，他們知道怎麼走，因為他們實際上去過那裡。1976年，美國政府詢問我們當中的一些人是否能通過計算機來再現營救過程？當然，我的一位同事說沒問題。然後，我們立刻得到一份來自國防部的合同。我們建造了這輛卡車，還有那個攝像頭裝置，憑藉當時的影像記錄，完成了一次模擬營救。這同樣發生在1976年。經過很多年之後，當時的卡車變成了這樣，於是我們有了谷歌地圖。 當時還是有人執意認為那不是嚴肅的電腦科學。但有一個人的觀點卻截然相反，他就是傑利·威斯納，當時恰巧是麻省理工學院 (MIT) 的院長。所以，要想在人生中展露鋒芒，有所作為，一定要拉你的老闆“入夥”。所以我在創建媒體實驗室的時候，就像是有個“大佬”在前面罩著。如果你因為超速而被截停，警官從車窗看進來，發現副駕駛位置坐著位“大佬”，他就會說“哦，先生，請繼續上路吧。”所以我們當時能夠大展身手。這個裝置十分精巧。這是一張傑利·威斯納的透鏡印刷照片，照片中唯一改變的就是嘴唇。當你搖晃那片帶有照片的透鏡板時，你會看到照片中的嘴唇以零頻寬同步。這就是當時的零頻寬遠端會議系統。 這就是媒體實驗室的概念圖，我們當時計畫建設的集電腦、出版等功能於一身的實驗室。同樣，它沒有得到普遍接受，但卻是早期 TED 的一部分。這正是我們追求的目標，引領我們創建了媒體實驗室。對於變老的問題，我可以很自信的告訴你們，我確實去過未來，並且去過那裡不止一次。我這麼說的原因是，我這一輩子似乎總在說：“在未來10年這些都會實現。”然後，10年過去了。接著又會說“在未來5年這些都會實現。”然後，5年過去了。我在做出這些預測的時候，多少感覺自己曾經去過未來不止一次。在我說過的所有預言中，被引用最多的就是“計算不再只和電腦有關，它關係到我們的生活。”起初這句話並沒有引起廣泛關注，之後慢慢受到重視。人們開始關注這句話是因為他們意識到，媒體並不是資訊。這裡所展示的這輛車，的確有點土，缺乏美感。展示它是因為我想通過它跟大家再分享一個對我的人生多少有點啟發的故事。我有一個博士研究生，他在全球定位系統GPS發明初期，設計了一個名為“後座司機”的系統，能夠為駕駛員提供自動導向，還會向駕駛員發出語音指令，比如，何時右轉，何時左轉。結果我們發現，當時設計的指令有些很難執行。比如說 “下一路口右轉”究竟是什麼意思？如果你駕車經過一條街道，下一個右轉可能是下下個路口。這裡面包含很多技術難題。這名學生的論文寫得很棒。但 MIT 專利辦公室卻說“別為它申請專利。這肯定行不通。責任太大，風險太高。還有保險問題。別為它申請專利。”所以我們放棄了。這件事再一次表明，人們有時對周邊正在發生的事情視若無睹。 下面，我準備快速回顧一下過去的一些研究工作。這裡有很多感測器元件。你也許認得出年輕時候的馬友友。我們利用感測器元件跟蹤他演奏大提琴時的肢體動作。當年，這幫傢夥就穿著這副行頭到處晃悠。現在稍微有所收斂，並且更司空見慣了。 在這裡，至少有三位傳奇人物我想跟大家介紹一下。第一位是馬文·明斯基（“人工智慧之父”），他教會了我很多常識性的東西。第二位是穆尼爾·庫伯（MIT出版社藝術總監），他對於理查·沃爾曼（TED創始人）以及 TED 的發展都至關重要。當時她走上 TED 講臺，說的第一句話就是“我把裡基介紹給了尼基。”沒人叫我“尼基”，也沒人稱呼理查“裡基”，所以大家都不知道她在說什麼。當然，還有西摩•·帕爾特（人工智慧先驅）。他曾經說過這麼一句話：“除非你意識到自己在思考，否則你根本無法思考。”這句話大家可以稍後解讀，確實非常深奧。 現在大家看到的是TED 2 使用的一些幻燈片，也許看上去有點不入潮流。那時候，我覺得電視機就是顯示器。我們經過了 TED 1，差不多到了 TED 2 的時代。在這裡，我想說的是——即使你能夠想像設備中使用的智慧技術——今天，我大致瞭解了一下最近有關物聯網的研究。我覺得這些研究非常悲哀，因為現實情況是這樣的：有人拿來烤箱控制面板，或門鑰匙，然後安裝到你的手機上。只是拿過來給你裝上。但你其實並不需要。你需要的是讓你的烤箱變得智慧化。比方說，你把一隻雞放進烤箱，它就會自動識別出這是一隻雞，知道這是為尼可拉斯烹飪的，知道尼古拉斯喜歡這樣和那樣的烹調方式。所以，智慧技術原本並不在設備中。今天我們開始讓它重新回到手機上，或更接近用戶。這不是有關物聯網特別具有啟發性的觀點。關於電視機，今天我講的是上世紀90年代的電視機。而未來的電視機看上去是這樣的。又有人發出冷笑，他們的笑聲沒有流露出讚賞之情。 上世紀90年代的電信業，喬治·吉爾德決定把這張圖稱為“尼葛洛龐帝式轉換”。喬治聲名顯赫，我恐怕望塵莫及，所以當喬治作出這個決定時，我有點受寵若驚。不過，當時我的一個預測——“今天在空中傳輸的，明天將轉入地下，而在地下傳輸的將轉到空中”終於慢慢變為了現實。這是那一年的原始幻燈片，與現實情況如出一轍。 我們創辦了《連線》雜誌。我記得當時我們會定期輪流當接待員。一次，有位家長怒氣衝衝地打電話來說他的兒子放棄了《體育畫報》，開始訂閱《連線》。他質問我們：“你們這本雜誌是黃書嗎？”無論如何，他都無法理解自己的兒子會對《連線》感興趣。 我要稍微加快一點兒速度。這是我的最愛——1995年《新聞週刊》的封底。好吧，讀一下。（笑聲） [""MIT媒體實驗室主任尼可拉斯·尼葛洛龐帝預測：人們很快就會直接通過網際網路購買書籍和報紙。呃，走著瞧吧。”—克利夫·斯托爾，《新聞週刊》，1995年] 有一點你必須承認，當有人說你大錯特錯時，你更應該全情投入，至少我會如此。 《數位化生存》問世了。對我來講，這本書讓我有機會更多地涉足商業新聞媒體，並把它推廣到普通大眾。同時，也讓我們建成了新的媒體實驗室。如果你還沒去過，歡迎來參觀。這裡不僅是工作的樂園，建築設計也是美不勝收。這些是我們在 TED 演講中提到過的東西。 [今天，由於多媒體設備仍很笨重，我們多半是在書房或起居室中操作多媒體。一旦我們有了小而薄、明亮、靈活、解析度高的顯示器以後，情況就會完全改觀。—1995年] 我們的夢想最終實現了。我每年都在期待這一天的到來。這是一次理查·沃爾曼終生難忘的聚會，他邀請了許多老朋友，其中也包括我。 後來我自己的工作重心發生了很大的轉變。我開始投入到電腦與學習的研究中，並且深受西摩的影響。在我看來，學習過程與電腦程式設計最為相近。在編寫電腦程式時，你並不只是列出清單，然後採用一種演算法，把清單轉化為一組指令。你還會碰到程式漏洞，所有程式都有漏洞，你必須想辦法解決。你必須進入並更改程式，然後重新執行。如此循環往復。這一循環過程與學習過程有異曲同工之處。 正是基於這一認識，我和西摩一起在柬埔寨等地展開了獨立研究，開始啟動“每個孩子一台筆記本”計畫。有關這項計畫的 TED 演講不勝枚舉，所以我會簡單地一語帶過。這項計畫確實讓我們有機會在更廣的範圍內，從事學習、發展與計算領域的研究。很少有人知道，“每個孩子一台筆記本”計畫是一個10億美元的專案。至少在我運作該項目的七年裡，已經耗資10億美元。更重要的是，世界銀行分文未出，我們也分文未收美國國際開發署的資金。資金主要是由實施計畫的國家通過自己的國債籌集而得。這是非常有趣的現象。至少從我下一步的工作計畫來看，我發現這一點很有趣。這就是我們實施計畫的地方。 我當時嘗試做了一個實驗。實驗地點在衣索比亞。這就是那次實驗。該實驗的目的是研究在沒有學校的地方，能否發生學習行為？我們向孩子們派發了一些筆記型電腦，但沒有附帶說明書，讓他們自己摸索。在很短的時間裡，孩子們不僅學會了開機，並在短短5天內每個孩子至少使用了50個應用程式，兩周內學會唱字母歌，而且六個月內成功入侵了安卓系統。這個過程太奇妙了。這可能是我擁有的最好的一張照片。右面那個孩子好像“自封”為老師。看看左面那個孩子，還有其他孩子。全程沒有任何成年人介入。所以我說，我們能否擴大計畫的範圍？這裡面還缺少什麼？此時，孩子們在召開新聞發佈會，好像在泥裡寫著什麼。問題是，還缺少什麼？看來我要略過預測了，因為時間快要到了。最後的問題是，接下來會發生什麼？ 我認為最大的挑戰是——讓世界上最後10億人接觸到網際網路。“連接最後十億人”與“連接下一個十億人”是兩個完全不同的概念。不同的原因在於，下一個十億人是容易實現的目標。而最後十億人卻身處“荒蠻之地”。荒蠻與貧窮是兩種完全不同的狀態。我們的社會容易造成貧窮，而且貧窮階層的人們境遇也各不相同。這最後10億人也許出身荒蠻，但接近和連接他們的方式，“每個孩子一台筆記本”計畫的成果，還有衣索比亞的實驗，讓我相信我們實際上能夠在很短的時間裡付諸行動。 所以我的計畫——很遺憾，我現在沒辦法找到合作夥伴，讓我宣佈這些計畫——我的計畫是利用同步軌道衛星連接最後10億人。在很多方面，同步軌道衛星不是最好的手段。但是，同步軌道衛星也有很多優勢。花費兩億美元就可以連接遠超1億人。我選擇“2億”這個數字的原因是——這是最後一張幻燈片。雖然2億美元聽上去很多，但其實這是我們在阿富汗一週的開銷。所以如果我們能夠用這些資金連接非洲，還有最後10億人，我們應該義無反顧。 謝謝大家。 （掌聲） 克里斯·安德森：請留步，請留步。 尼可拉斯·尼葛洛龐帝:你要再多給我一點時間嗎？ 克里斯: 不是。你說話真風趣，很機智。演講十分精彩。尼可拉斯，談談你的預測吧？（笑聲） 尼可拉斯·尼葛洛龐帝:感謝你的提問。我來告訴你我的預測是什麼。這只是預測，因為三十年後才會發生，那時我不可能再回到這裡。這個預測是有關學習如何閱讀的。一直以來，我們都是靠眼睛閱讀大量的資訊。這種管道可能效率很低。所以我的預測是——將來人們會靠嘴巴“攝取”資訊。吃一粒藥丸就學會英語，吃一粒藥丸就理解莎士比亞。學習過程通過血液循環完成。只要資訊流入血液，它基本就會流向大腦，等到流向大腦，進入不同的區域，就會儲存在相應的位置。所以是“攝取”資訊。 克里斯: 你最近和雷·庫茲韋爾出去玩耍了嗎？（雷·庫茲韋爾：谷歌工程總監） 尼可拉斯·尼葛洛龐帝: 沒有，但我和埃德·博伊登出去逛過。（埃德·博伊登：MIT大腦、認知科學和生物工程學副教授）還有今天在場的休·赫爾教授（MIT生物機械工程研究所主任），他也是 TED 的演講嘉賓之一。我還有其他很多玩伴。這個預測並非不著邊際，30年後就會見分曉。 克理斯: 我們將拭目以待。30年後，我們會重新回到這裡，觀看這段錄影，然後大家一起吞下紅色藥丸。 非常感謝你的分享。 尼可拉斯·尼葛洛龐帝。 尼可拉斯: 謝謝大家。 （掌聲）"
