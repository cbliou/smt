helder_guimaraes_a_magical_search_for_a_coincidence	"I'd like to start my performance by saying 90 percent of everything is crap. (Laughter) It's called Sturgeon's law, and what that means is that the majority of anything is always bad. I have a giraffe here. I'm going to throw the giraffe behind my back and whoever catches it is going to help me on this next thing. Sir, you caught the giraffe. I have a playing card in my hand. Freely name any card in the deck. Audience member: 10 of hearts. Helder Guimarães: 10 of hearts. You could have named any card in the deck, but you said the 10 of hearts. Ninety percent of everything is crap, so there's this to prove that Sturgeon was correct. (Laughter) (Applause) (Laughter) Sir, this is not your show. (Laughter) Keep the giraffe for a moment, okay? Jesus. (Laughter) Crazy people. Well, the truth is, why is the majority of everything bad? And my answer is: I think we stop thinking too soon. I'll give you a clear little example, something that people used to do around the turn of the century — not this century, the other one. The idea was to take a piece of paper and fold it inside out using only your weaker hand, in my case, the left hand. Something that would look like this. By the way you reacted, I can see your lack of interest. (Laughter) But that's okay, I understand why. We stop thinking too soon. But if we give it a little bit more thought, like a paper clip. A paper clip makes this a little bit more interesting. Not only that, if instead of using my hand with the fingers, I use my hand closed into a fist, that makes this even a little bit more interesting. Not only that, but I will impose myself a time limit of one second, something that would look like this. Now — no, no, no. Sturgeon may be correct. But he doesn't have to be correct forever. Things can always change. Sir, what was the card? The 10 of hearts? There's this to prove that things can always change — the 10 of hearts. (Applause) Secrets are important. And secrets are valuable. And this is the best secret I've ever experienced. It starts with a deck of cards onto the table, an old man and a claim, ""I will not touch the deck till the end."" It doesn't matter who the man was, all that matters was that sentence ringing in my head: ""I will not touch the deck till the end."" Now, during all this time, he was holding a small notebook that sometimes he would open and flip through the pages and look at something. But I was not really paying attention to the book because I was paying attention the deck and the claim he had made before, ""I will not touch the deck till the end."" Now sir, you have the giraffe. Go ahead, throw it in any direction so that you can find someone else at random. Perfect. Sir, you're going to play my role in this story. The old man turned to me and he said, ""You could pick a red card or a black card."" My answer was ... Audience member 2: The black card. HG: Indeed! It was a black card. He said, ""It could be a club or a spade,"" and my answer was ... Audience member 2: Spade. HG: Indeed! It was a spade. He said, ""It could be a high spade or a low spade."" And my answer was ... Audience member 2: A high spade. HG: Indeed! It was a high spade. Since it's a high spade, it could be a nine, a 10, a jack, king, queen or the ace of spades. And my answer was ... Audience member 2: The king. HG: The king of spades, indeed. Now sir, let's be fair. You selected black, you selected spade, you selected the high spade, and you selected — sorry? Audience member 2: King. HG: King of spades. Did you feel I influenced you in any decision? Audience member 2: No, I just felt your energy. HG: But it was a free choice, correct? Because if not, we could start all over again. But it was really fair? Audience member 2: Absolutely. HG: Now, the old man turned to me and he asked me one more question, a number between one and 52. And the first number I thought of was ... Audience member 2: 17. HG: Indeed! It was the 17. The old man only said one more thing: ""This is the end."" And I knew exactly what that meant. I knew that he was going to touch the deck. Everything that you're about to see is exactly as it looked. He took the deck out of the box. Nothing in the box. He counted, ""One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10."" The tension was building. (Laughter) ""11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17."" And on the 17, instead of the king of spades, something appeared in the middle of the deck, that later, I would realize was actually a secret. The old man stood up, he left. I never saw him again. But he left his notebook that was there from the beginning. And when I picked it up, that was the best secret I've ever experienced. We are defined by the secrets we keep and by the secrets we share. And this was his way of sharing a secret with me. (Applause) Crazy shit! Now — (Laughter) I believe that amazing things happen all the time. I really do. And the reason why we don't see them as often, it's because we don't place ourselves in a position to search for those amazing things. But what if we decided to search for those amazing things, for those small coincidences in life that are truly amazing? So you have the giraffe, go ahead, throw it in any direction so you find one last person at random. Sir, I'm going to ask you, do you have, with you, a United States $1 bill? Audience member 3: I think so. HG: Yes? You see, a coincidence! (Laughter) Let's make sure you have it. Do you have it? Audience member 3: Yes. HG: Yes! Perfect. Now, I want you to do exactly the same thing I am about to do. I have a dollar bill here to explain. I want you to take the dollar bill, and fold the Washington part inside, like this. So you get this kind of big square, okay? Now, I want you to take the bill and fold it like this, lengthwise, so it becomes like a rectangle, and then again — really fold it, really crease it — and when you have it, please fold the bill again into a little square like this and let me know when you have it. Do you have it? Perfect. Now, I'm going to approach, and before we start, I want to make sure that we do this in very, very serious conditions. First of all, I want to ensure that we have a marker and we have a paper clip. First of all, take the marker and go ahead and sign the bill. And this is the reason why: later, I'm going to be doing a bunch of stuff on stage and I don't want you to think, oh, while I was distracted by Helder, someone came onstage and swapped the bill. So I want to make sure it's exactly the same bill. Now not only that, I want you to take the paper clip and put it around the bill. So even if nobody comes onstage and switches the bill, I don't have enough time to go open the bill and close it and see what I don't want to see. Is that fair? Now you can give me the marker back. And just like that, very clearly, I want to make sure that we place this in full view from the beginning of this experience and to make sure that everyone is going to see it, we're going to actually have a camera man onstage. Yes, perfect, so that you can see. That's your signature? Yes? Perfect. Now, we're going to use also the deck and a glass for this. And we're going to put ourselves in a position to search for an amazing coincidence. Do you mind, can you help me with this? Go ahead and take some cards and shuffle. And do you mind, can you take some cards and shuffle? You can take some cards and shuffle. You can shuffle cards in a variety of ways. You can shuffle cards like this. You can shuffle cards in a more messed up way, something like this. You can shuffle cards in the American way. As a Portuguese, I don't feel entitled to teach you guys how to do it. But the important part is after shuffling the cards, always remember to cut and complete the cards. Do you mind doing that for me, sir? Please cut and complete. And when you have it, place the cards up in the air. And you too, cut and complete and up in the air. Up in the air. A deck of cards cut and shuffled by one, two, three, four and five people. Now, very clearly, I'm going to gather the deck together. And just like that. I'm going to search for a coincidence in front of everyone. I'm going to try. I have some cards that maybe, maybe they don't mean anything. But maybe that's because we are not paying close attention. Because maybe, maybe they mean a lot. Before we start, sir, you gave me a dollar bill. Is that your signature? Audience member 3: Yes it is. HG: I want you to see very clearly that I'm going to open your bill and reveal a small secret that we created. And the secret of this dollar bill is the serial number. Madam, can you take the dollar bill? In the serial number, there is a letter. What is the first number after the letter? Audience member 4: Seven. HG: Seven. Seven. But, that's maybe just one coincidence. What is the second number? Audience member 4: Nine. So after the seven, we have a nine. And after the nine? Audience member 4: Two. HG: The two. And after the two? Audience member 4: Three. HG: Three, and after? Audience member 4: Three. HG: Three. Audience member 4: Seven. HG: Seven. Audience member 4: Four. HG: Four. Audience member 4: Two. HG: Two, and? Audience member 4: Q. HG: Q like in queen? (Applause) The queen of clubs! All the cards in order, just for you. And that's my show. Thank you very much and have a nice night. (Applause)"	在表演開始前，我想先告訴大家，任何事的百分之九十都是扯淡。（笑聲）這叫史特金定律，它的意思是大部分的事情都是不好的。 我這裡有一隻長頸鹿。我現在要轉身把這隻長頸鹿扔出去接到這隻長頸鹿的人將幫助我完成下一個任務。先生，您接到了長頸鹿。我手裡有一張紙牌。請在一副牌中任意選出一張牌。紅心10。紅心10。一副牌中您可以選任意一張牌，但是您選擇了紅心10。任何事物的百分之九十都是扯淡，因此我們用這張牌來證明史特金是對的。（笑聲）（掌聲）（笑聲）先生，這不是您的場子。（笑聲）請暫時保管一下長頸鹿，好嗎？天啊。（笑聲）瘋子。 好吧，事實是，為什麼大部分的事情都是壞的？而我的答案是：我認為我們過早地停止了思考。我舉一個簡單明瞭的例子，在世紀之交人們常做一件事——不是這個世紀，是另一個。這個想法是把一張紙只用你的非慣用手向外摺疊。於我而言是左手。疊成像這樣的一個東西。看你們的反應，我就知道你們對這毫無興趣。（笑聲）但是沒關係，我知道為甚麼。我們過早地停止了思考。 但是要是我們加點主意，比如說用一個迴紋針。一個迴紋針會讓這變得稍微有意思一點。不僅是這樣，如果我不用手指，而是把手攥成拳頭，就會讓這甚至更有意思一點。不僅是這樣，我還要在一秒鐘之內完成，就像這樣。現在——不對，不對，不對。史特金有可能是對的。但是他不用永遠正確。事物永遠能被改變。先生，那張紙牌是什麼來著？紅心10？這證明事物總能改變——紅心10。（掌聲） 秘密很重要。而且秘密很珍貴。而這是我經歷過的最妙的秘密。它由桌子上的一副紙牌開始，還有一個老人和一個承諾，「我直到最後才會碰這摞紙牌。」那個老人是誰沒有關係，重點在於我腦海裡迴響的那句話：「我直到最後才會碰這摞紙牌。」 現在，在這段時間裡，他拿著一個小筆記本有時他會打開並翻一翻然後看一看。但是我並沒有關注筆記本因為我注意著摺疊紙牌，還有他之前講過的承諾，「我直到最後才會碰這摞紙牌。」 現在，先生，您有隻只長頸鹿。扔吧，衝著任何角度扔隨意選出一個人。好極了。先生，你現在來扮演我的角色。老人轉身面對我說，「你可以在紅牌和黑牌裡選一張。」我的答案是⋯⋯黑牌。沒錯！是張黑牌。他說：「它可以是黑桃或梅花。」然後我的答案是⋯⋯黑桃。沒錯！就是張黑桃。他說：「它可以是一張大黑桃或者小黑桃。」然後我的答案是⋯⋯大黑桃。沒錯！是大黑桃。既然是大黑桃，它可以是一張黑桃九、十、J、國王、皇后或是愛司。然後我的答案是⋯⋯國王。黑桃國王，沒錯！現在先生，公道講句。您選了黑色，選了黑桃，您選了黑桃大牌，然後選了——什麼來著？國王。黑桃國王。您覺得我有否影響到您的決定了嗎？沒有，我只感到了您的能量。但是您是出於自由意志的，對吧？因為若不是這樣，我們可以從頭再來一遍。但是這果真公道嗎？觀眾乙：當然。 現在，老人轉向我，並又問了我一個問題，在1到52之間，選一個數字。然後我想到的第一個數字是⋯⋯17。沒錯！是17。老人只對我說了最後一件事：「結束了。」然後我確切地知道他要做什麼。我知道他要去碰這一副牌了。你們將看到的一切跟之前所發生的一模一樣。他從盒子裡取出了那一副牌，盒子空了。他數道，「1，2，3，4，5，6，7，8，9，10」氣氛越來越緊張。（笑聲）「⋯⋯11，12，13，14，15，16，17。」在第17張牌，不是黑桃國王，有個東西出現在了這摞牌中間，接下來，我將實現的實則是個秘密。 老人起身走了。我再也沒有見過他。但他留下了他的筆記本從始至終在這裡的那本。當我撿起它時，這簡直是我經歷過的最妙的秘密。我們共同保守、共同分享的秘密是對我們自己的定義。而這就是他和我分享秘密的方式。（掌聲）這太瘋狂了！現在——（笑聲） 我相信神奇的事時時刻刻都在發生。我真的相信。我們不能常常見到這種事是因為我們沒有主動尋找這些奇事。是因為我們沒有主動尋找這些奇事。但是我們若決心去尋找奇事，決心尋找真正神奇的小巧合，又會怎樣呢？先生，您現在拿著長頸鹿，扔吧，隨便一個角度扔出去隨機選出一個人。先生，我要問問您，您身上有一美元的紙幣嗎？觀眾丙：我應該有。有？看吧，巧合！（笑聲）讓我確認一下您有。您有嗎？觀眾丙：有。積馬瑞斯：好的！完美。接下來我要您跟著我來做。我有一張一美元紙幣來解釋。我要你拿著這一美元，然後把華盛頓頭像摺起來，就像這樣。您差不多得到了一個大方塊，對吧？現在，我想讓您把紙幣摺成這樣，縱向地折，變成了個長方形，然後——使勁摺，使勁疊——當您做完這一步後，請再次摺疊，當您做完後告訴我。有了嗎？好的。 下面，我要走到您旁邊了，當我們開始前，我要確認我們很嚴肅地在做這件事。首先，我要確保我們有一根記號筆和一個迴紋針。首先，用記號筆在這張紙幣上簽名。原因是稍後，我將在台上做一系列的事我不想讓大家以為，噢，趁著埃爾德在分散我的注意力，有人上台調換了紙幣。所以我要確認這的確是同樣的紙幣。不僅這樣，我要你用迴紋針夾住紙幣。所以即使有人上台調換了紙幣，我也沒有足夠的時間去打開紙幣再闔上它從而看見我不想看見的。公平嗎？現在請還給我記號筆。 就像這樣，清楚地，我要確保我們把它擺放在視線裡從這個體驗的一開始就這樣並為了確保每個人都能看見它，我們將請一位攝影師上台。對，很好，現在大家就能看見了。這是您的簽名嗎？是？很好。現在，我們要用那副牌和一個杯子。我們要把自己放在一個尋找奇事的狀態。 您介意幫我一下嗎？請抽些牌然後洗牌。您可以抽些牌來洗牌嗎？您能抽些牌然後洗牌。您可以隨意洗牌。您可以這樣洗牌。您可以更混亂地洗牌。像這樣。您可以用美式洗牌。作為葡萄牙人，我想我沒有資格教你們怎麼洗牌。但是重要的是，洗牌之後一定記得切牌並合上牌。 您介意為我做這一步嗎，先生？請切牌並合上牌。做完後，請把牌舉起來。您也是，切牌並合上牌，然後把牌舉起來。請舉起來。這是一副被一、二、三、四、五個人洗過的牌 現在，清楚地，我要把這一副牌放回一起。就像這樣。我要在你們每個人面前尋找巧合。我要試著這樣做。我有一些牌，它們或許什麼含義都沒有。但是也許是因為我們沒有仔細注意。因為或許，或許它們有著很重要的意義。在我們開始前，先生，您給了我一美元紙幣。這是您的簽名嗎？是的，正是。現在我要讓您仔細看好我要打開您的紙幣並揭開我們創造的小秘密。這張紙幣的秘密是它的序列號。 女士，您能拿著這張一美元紙幣嗎？在序列號中，有一個字母。這個字母後的第一個數字是什麼？7。7。7。但這或許只是一個巧合。第二個數字是什麼？9。所以在7之後，我們得到了9。9之後呢？2。是2。2之後呢？3。3，然後呢？3。3。7。7。4。4。2。2，然後？Q。皇后的那個Q？ （掌聲）梅花后！整摞牌排好了，為您。 這就是我的表演。感謝諸位，祝大家晚安。 （掌聲）
