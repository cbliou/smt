There is the gallery somewhere in the world, and there is a young girl, age 23, standing in the middle of the space. In the front of her is a table. On the table there are 76 objects for pleasure and for pain. Some of the objects are a glass of water, a coat, a shoe, a rose. But also the knife, the razor blade, the hammer and the pistol with one bullet. There are instructions which say, ""I'm an object. You can use everything on the table on me. I'm taking all responsibility — even killing me. And the time is six hours."" The beginning of this performance was easy. People would give me the glass of water to drink, they'd give me the rose. But very soon after, there was a man who took the scissors and cut my clothes, and then they took the thorns of the rose and stuck them in my stomach. Somebody took the razor blade and cut my neck and drank the blood, and I still have the scar. The women would tell the men what to do. And the men didn't rape me because it was just a normal opening, and it was all public, and they were with their wives. They carried me around and put me on the table, and put the knife between my legs. And somebody took the pistol and bullet and put it against my temple. And another person took the pistol and they started a fight. And after six hours were finished, I... started walking towards the public. I was a mess. I was half-naked, I was full of blood and tears were running down my face. And everybody escaped, they just ran away. They could not confront myself, with myself as a normal human being. And then — what happened is I went to the hotel, it was at two in the morning. And I looked at myself in the mirror, and I had a piece of gray hair. Alright — please take off your blindfolds. Welcome to the performance world. First of all, let's explain what the performance is. So many artists, so many different explanations, but my explanation for performance is very simple. Performance is a mental and physical construction that the performer makes in a specific time in a space in front of an audience and then energy dialogue happens. The audience and the performer make the piece together. And the difference between performance and theater is huge. In the theater, the knife is not a knife and the blood is just ketchup. In the performance, the blood is the material, and the razor blade or knife is the tool. It's all about being there in the real time, and you can't rehearse performance, because you can't do many of these types of things twice — ever. Which is very important, the performance is — you know, all human beings are always afraid of very simple things. We're afraid of suffering, we're afraid of pain, we're afraid of mortality. So what I'm doing — I'm staging these kinds of fears in front of the audience. I'm using your energy, and with this energy I can go and push my body as far as I can. And then I liberate myself from these fears. And I'm your mirror. If I can do this for myself, you can do it for you. After Belgrade, where I was born, I went to Amsterdam. And you know, I've been doing performances since the last 40 years. And here I met Ulay, and he was the person I actually fell in love with. And we made, for 12 years, performances together. You know the knife and the pistols and the bullets, I exchange into love and trust. So to do this kind work you have to trust the person completely because this arrow is pointing to my heart. So, heart beating and adrenaline is rushing and so on, is about trust, is about total trust to another human being. Our relationship was 12 years, and we worked on so many subjects, both male and female energy. And as every relationship comes to an end, ours went too. We didn't make phone calls like normal human beings do and say, you know, ""This is over."" We walked the Great Wall of China to say goodbye. I started at the Yellow Sea, and he started from the Gobi Desert. We walked, each of us, three months, two and a half thousand kilometers. It was the mountains, it was difficult. It was climbing, it was ruins. It was, you know, going through the 12 Chinese provinces, this was before China was open in '87. And we succeeded to meet in the middle to say goodbye. And then our relationship stopped. And now, it completely changed how I see the public. And one very important piece I made in those days was ""Balkan Baroque."" And this was the time of the Balkan Wars, and I wanted to create some very strong, charismatic image, something that could serve for any war at any time, because the Balkan Wars are now finished, but there's always some war, somewhere. So here I am washing two and a half thousand dead, big, bloody cow bones. You can't wash the blood, you never can wash shame off the wars. So I'm washing this six hours, six days, and wars are coming off these bones, and becoming possible — an unbearable smell. But then something stays in the memory. I want to show you the one who really changed my life, and this was the performance in MoMa, which I just recently made. This performance — when I said to the curator, ""I'm just going to sit at the chair, and there will be an empty chair at the front, and anybody from the public can come and sit as long as they want."" The curator said to me, ""That's ridiculous, you know, this is New York, this chair will be empty, nobody has time to sit in front of you."" (Laughter) But I sit for three months. And I sit everyday, eight hours — the opening of the museum — and 10 hours on Friday when the museum is open 10 hours, and I never move. And I removed the table and I'm still sitting, and this changed everything. This performance, maybe 10 or 15 years ago — nothing would have happened. But the need of people to actually experience something different, the public was not anymore the group — relation was one to one. I was watching these people, they would come and sit in front of me, but they would have to wait for hours and hours and hours to get to this position, and finally, they sit. And what happened? They are observed by the other people, they're photographed, they're filmed by the camera, they're observed by me and they have nowhere to escape except in themselves. And that makes a difference. There was so much pain and loneliness, there's so much incredible things when you look in somebody else's eyes, because in the gaze with that total stranger, that you never even say one word — everything happened. And I understood when I stood up from that chair after three months, I am not the same anymore. And I understood that I have a very strong mission, that I have to communicate this experience to everybody. And this is how, for me, was born the idea to have an institute of immaterial performing arts. Because thinking about immateriality, performance is time-based art. It's not like a painting. You have the painting on the wall, the next day it's there. Performance, if you are missing it, you only have the memory, or the story of somebody else telling you, but you actually missed the whole thing. So you have to be there. And in my point, if you talk about immaterial art, music is the highest — absolutely highest art of all, because it's the most immaterial. And then after this is performance, and then everything else. That's my subjective way. This institute is going to happen in Hudson, upstate New York, and we are trying to build with Rem Koolhaas, an idea. And it's very simple. If you want to get experience, you have to give me your time. You have to sign the contract before you enter the building, that you will spend there a full six hours, you have to give me your word of honor. It's something so old-fashioned, but if you don't respect your own word of honor and you leave before — that's not my problem. But it's six hours, the experience. And then after you finish, you get a certificate of accomplishment, so get home and frame it if you want. (Laughter) This is orientation hall. The public comes in, and the first thing you have to do is dress in lab coats. It's this importance of stepping from being just a viewer into experimenter. And then you go to the lockers and you put your watch, your iPhone, your iPod, your computer and everything digital, electronic. And you are getting free time for yourself for the first time. Because there is nothing wrong with technology, our approach to technology is wrong. We are losing the time we have for ourselves. This is an institute to actually give you back this time. So what you do here, first you start slow walking, you start slowing down. You're going back to simplicity. After slow walking, you're going to learn how to drink water — very simple, drinking water for maybe half an hour. After this, you're going to the magnet chamber, where you're going to create some magnet streams on your body. Then after this, you go to crystal chamber. After crystal chamber, you go to eye-gazing chamber, after eye-gazing chamber, you go to a chamber where you are lying down. So it's the three basic positions of the human body, sitting, standing and lying. And slow walking. And there is a sound chamber. And then after you've seen all of this, and prepared yourself mentally and physically, then you are ready to see something with a long duration, like in immaterial art. It can be music, it can be opera, it can be a theater piece, it can be film, it can be video dance. You go to the long duration chairs because now you are comfortable. In the long duration chairs, you're transported to the big place where you're going to see the work. And if you fall asleep, which is very possible because it's been a long day, you're going to be transported to the parking lot. (Laughter) And you know, sleeping is very important. In sleeping, you're still receiving art. So in the parking lot you stay for a certain amount of time, and then after this you just, you know, go back, you see more of the things you like to see or go home with your certificate. So this institute right now is virtual. Right now, I am just making my institute in Brazil, then it's going to be in Australia, then it's coming here, to Canada and everywhere. And this is to experience a kind of simple method, how you go back to simplicity in your own life. Counting rice will be another thing. (Laughter) You know, if you count rice you can make life, too. How to count rice for six hours? It's incredibly important. You know, you go through this whole range of being bored, being angry, being completely frustrated, not finishing the amount of rice you're counting. And then this unbelievable amount of peace you get when satisfying work is finished — or counting sand in the desert. Or having the sound-isolated situation — that you have headphones, that you don't hear anything, and you're just there together without sound, with the people experiencing silence, just the simple silence. We are always doing things we like in our life. And this is why you're not changing. You do things in life — it's just nothing happens if you always do things the same way. But my method is to do things I'm afraid of, the things I fear, the things I don't know, to go to territory that nobody's ever been. And then also to include the failure. I think failure is important because if you go, if you experiment, you can fail. If you don't go into that area and you don't fail, you are actually repeating yourself over and over again. And I think that human beings right now need a change, and the only change to be made is a personal level change. You have to make the change on yourself. Because the only way to change consciousness and to change the world around us, is to start with yourself. It's so easy to criticize how it's different, the things in the world and they're not right, and the governments are corrupted and there's hunger in the world and there's wars — the killing. But what we do on the personal level — what is our contribution to this whole thing? Can you turn to your neighbor, the one you don't know, and look at them for two full minutes in their eyes, right now? (Chatter) I'm asking two minutes of your time, that's so little. Breathe slowly, don't try to blink, don't be self-conscious. Be relaxed. And just look a complete stranger in your eyes, in his eyes. (Silence) Thank you for trusting me. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you so much."	"現在...讓我們回到過去。回到1974年，在世界的某個地方有一個藝廊。有一位23歲的年輕女孩站在那個空間的中間，在她面前的是一張桌子。桌上有76個物品，是為了取悅和痛苦。那些物品包含一杯水、一件外套、一隻鞋、一朵玫瑰，但也有一把刀子、刀片、鐵鎚，及一把槍，附上一顆子彈。旁邊的說明書這麼寫著：「我就是一件物品 ，你可以在我身上使用桌上的任何東西，我承擔所有責任──即使把我殺了也可以，而時間是六小時。」 這個表演一開始很輕鬆。觀眾會給我一杯水喝，他們會給我一朵玫瑰，但很快地，有一位男士拿了剪刀把我的衣服剪破，然後他們拔起玫瑰尖刺並刺進我的腹部。有個人拿起刀片，割了我的頸部並喝了我的血。那個刀疤仍在我身上。女人會指使男人怎麼做，沒有男人強暴我，因為那是一個尋常的展覽場合，有其他觀展者，而且他們的妻子就跟在旁邊。他們把我移來移去、帶到桌上，然後把刀子放在我的兩腿之間。其中一人拿了槍、裝上子彈並用槍指著我的太陽穴，另一人把槍搶走，他們開始打架。 六個小時結束後，我……開始走向群眾，我殘破不堪。我半裸、流了很多血、臉上眼淚不停地流。每個人避開、逃跑，他們無法面對我，這個身為普通人的我。然後......接下來發生的事就是，我一個人在凌晨二點走進旅館，然後，我面對鏡中的自己，發現我有了一根灰白的頭髮。好的，請拿下你們的眼罩。 歡迎來到「表演」的世界。首先，讓我們解釋一下「表演」是甚麼？有很多藝術家有不同的解釋，但我對「表演」的解釋相當簡單。表演就是：表演者用身體和心靈建構的狀態，在某一時間、空間中，呈現在觀眾面前。然後彼此會有「能量對話」的發生。觀眾與表演者一起創作出作品。表演和戲劇有很大的不同。在戲劇中，刀子不是刀子，而血只是番茄醬。在表演中，血是素材，而刀片或刀子則是工具。表演的核心，就是當下一定要在場，而且你不能事前排演，因為這些作品的呈現型態，你絕對不可能重現兩次。這非常重要，表演這事—你知道的，人類總是害怕非常簡單的事，我們害怕受苦，我們害怕痛苦，我們害怕死亡的事。所以我做的是—我在觀眾面前展現這一類的害怕。我在利用你的能量。用你的能量，我盡可能把自己的身體推到一個極限。然後我從這些恐懼中解放了我自己。而我就是你的鏡子。如果我可以這樣做，你自己也可以。 我在貝爾格萊德出生後，(南斯拉夫首都)我去了阿姆斯特丹。各位應該知道我近40年來都在從事表演。在這裡我遇見了烏雷，他就是那個讓我真正墜入情網的人。我們一起從事表演12年。你知道刀子、槍、子彈，我把它們轉變成愛與信任，所以呈現這種作品時，你必須完全相信那個人。因為弓箭直指著我的心臟，所以，心臟跳得很快，腎上腺素旺盛的流竄等等．．．就是信任，就是完全信任另一個人。 我們的關係持續了12年，我們一起創作了很多作品，包含男性和女性的能量。每一段關係最終都會結束，我們兩個的也是，我們不像一般人會打電話，然後跟對方說"" 我們結束吧 ""我們去中國長城說再見，我從黃海開始走，他從戈壁沙漠開始走，我們每個人走了三個月，2500公里。它有山，很艱辛，它有廢墟，得用爬的，你知道的，它貫穿了中國12個省，當時是在87年中國開放之前，我們成功的在中間相遇，並互道再見。然後我們的關係結束。 現在，這件事完全改變我如何看待大眾。在那個時期我有一件很重要的作品，就是 ""巴爾幹巴洛克""這就是當時的巴爾幹戰爭，而我想創造強烈、吸引人目光的照片。這照片可以象徵任何時間發生的戰爭，雖然巴爾幹戰爭已經結束，但某些地方仍有戰爭。我在這邊洗...２５００隻死亡、大型、血腥母牛骨頭。你無法洗掉血，你無法洗掉戰爭的醜陋。所以，我每天洗六小時，洗了六天，這些骨頭所帶的戰爭記憶逐漸被洗掉，漸漸地變成一種...難以忍受的味道。但之後某件事會停留在記憶裡。 我想告訴你們，有個表演，完全的改變我的一生。就是最近我在MoMa的表演，我向策展人說明這個表演的方式—"" 我會坐在一張椅子上 """" 前面會有一張空椅子 """" 任何人都可以坐在這，想坐多久就多久 ""策展人對我說，"" 這太荒謬了，你知道，這裡是紐約耶 ，"""" 那張椅子會空著， """" 沒人有時間坐在你面前 。"" ( 笑聲 ) 但我坐了3個月，博物館每天早上一開們，我就坐8個小時。禮拜五博物館開到10點，我就坐10個小時，我沒移動。然後我移開桌子，但我仍坐著，而這件事改變了一切。這表演若在10或15年前—沒事會發生。但人們的需求正在經歷某種變化。大眾不再是一個群體，而是一對一的關係。我看著這些人，他們坐在我面前，但他們得等很久，好幾、好幾個小時，才能坐到這位置上，最後，他們坐上來了。 發生了甚麼事?他們被另一個人觀察，他們被相機拍照、錄影。他們被我觀察除了他們的內在，他們沒地方躲藏，而這產生了一種差異。這裡面有這麼多的痛苦和寂寞，當你進入了他們的眼神，有那麼多難以置信的事，因為在你凝視這個完全陌生的人時，你沒說話，但每件事都發生了。三個月後，我明白當我從那張椅子站起來時，我也變得不一樣了。我了解了我有個強烈的使命，我必須向每個人交流這次的經歷。 因此我有了一個想法產生，去開辦一個非物質表演藝術的機構。因為想到非物質，表演是種以時間為基礎的藝術。它不像一幅畫，你掛在牆上的畫，隔天仍會在那。表演，一但你錯過了它，你擁有的僅剩回憶，或者某人告訴你的故事，但你實際上仍錯過了整件事。所以你必須要在場。就我的觀點，如果你要談論非物質藝術，音樂是最高等級的—絕對是所有藝術裡面最高等級的。因為它是最非物質的，之後是這種表演，然後其他..這是我主觀的觀點。 這個機構即將成立於紐約上州的哈德森。我們和荷蘭建築師Rem Koolhaas合作，嘗試建構一個概念，這概念很簡單，如果你想要體驗，你必須給我你的時間。在你進入建築物前，你必須簽約，你會在裡面待滿6個小時，你必須給我你的誓言，這有點老套。但如果你沒有遵守你的誓言，而提前離開—那就不關我的事。但體驗有6小時。在你結束後，你會得到一個成就認證。如果你想要的話，拿回家把它裱框起來。 ( 笑聲 ) 這是培訓大廳。大家進來後，第一件事就是換上實驗衣。有件事很重要—就是你從一個觀看者變成體驗者。你要去置物櫃，把你的手錶，iPhone，iPod，電腦等每一件電子數位產品放進置物櫃。而你會第一次體會到完全屬於自己的時刻。因為這不是科技的錯，是我們對待科技的方式是錯的。我們正在浪費屬於我們自己的時間。這個機構會真的將這種時間還給你。 你所要做的事就是...首先，你開始慢步走，開始慢下來。你會回到一種單純的境界。慢步走後，你會學如何喝水。很單純，也許花半小時去喝它。之後，你會到一個磁力室，一個你在你身上製造磁流的地方之後，你會來到水晶室。水晶室之後，你到眼神凝視室，眼神凝視室後，你會到一個可以躺下的地方。所以這是人類基本的三個動作—坐著、站著、躺著，及慢步走。然後有一個聲音室。你領會完全部這些後，並把自己的身心準備好，然後你已準備好要花一段長時間去領會某件事了，像是在非物質藝術裡一樣。它可以是音樂、歌劇、劇場作品...可以是影片、跳舞影像...你會在長躺椅上，因為你現在很舒服。在長躺椅上，你會被送到一個大空間，一個你將領會作品的地方如果你睡著，那是有可能的，因為是很長的一天。你會被送到停車場。 ( 笑聲 ) 你也知道，睡眠很重要。在睡眠時，你仍在接收藝術。所以在停車場，你會停留一陣時間，之後，你只要，你知道的，回家你會對你想的事會有更多的領悟，或者拿著認證回家。 現在這個機構是虛擬的，目前，我正在巴西建立這個機構，它也將會到澳洲建立，現在它來到這裡，到加拿大及每個地方，用簡單的方法去經歷體驗，在你的生命中，如何回到簡單樸質的生活？"" 數米 ""也是另一種方法。 ( 笑聲 ) 你知道，如果你數米，你也能過活的。要怎麼數米數6小時?這相當重要。你知道的，整個過程你會覺得無聊、生氣、相當氣餒，沒辦法數完你要數的米。但當令人滿意的作品完成後，你卻會得到無法置信的心靈平靜。或者在沙漠中""數沙粒""，或是經歷 "" 聲音隔離 ""狀態—就是你雖有耳機，但你卻聽不到任何聲音，而你們只是在那個無聲的地方聚集在一起，一起與其他人體驗寂靜，很單純的寂靜狀態。 在我們生命中，我們總是在做我們喜歡的事。而這也是為什麼你沒有改變。在你生命中做的事—如果你總是用同樣的方式在做事，不會有事情發生。但我的方法是：去做我害怕的事、我不懂的事、去到沒人到達過的領域， 而這也包含失敗。我認為失敗很重要。因為如果你往前、去體驗，你可能會失敗。但如果你躊躇不前、不去經歷失敗，那你只是不斷地在原地、重複循環罷了。我認為人類現在需要改變，而唯一要改變的僅是個人層面的改變。你必須在自己身上做出改變，因為唯一改變意識的方法、唯一改變我們周遭的世界的方法，就是從你自身做起。我們很容易批評今非昔比、世界上有這麼多錯事，政府的腐敗、世界的飢荒...戰爭、殺戮等等....但我們在個人層面改變所做的事—我們在這些事情上的貢獻會是甚麼呢? 現在，可以請各位轉向面對你的鄰居？找一個你不認識的人，專注的看著他們的眼睛2分鐘 ( 交談聲 ) 請各位給我2分鐘時間，這時間很短。慢慢呼吸，眼神不要閃爍或感覺不自在放輕鬆...把一個完全不認識的人，看進你的眼裡、看進他的眼裡。 ( 安靜 )謝謝你們信任我。 ( 掌聲 ) Chris Anderson：謝謝妳。非常謝謝你。"
