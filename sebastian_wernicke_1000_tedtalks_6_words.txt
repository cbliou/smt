sebastian_wernicke_1000_tedtalks_6_words	"There's currently over a thousand TED Talks on the TED website. And I guess many of you here think that this is quite fantastic, except for me, I don't agree with this. I think we have a situation here. Because if you think about it, 1,000 TED Talks, that's over 1,000 ideas worth spreading. How on earth are you going to spread a thousand ideas? Even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head by watching all those thousand TED videos, it would actually currently take you over 250 hours to do so. And I did a little calculation of this. The damage to the economy for each one who does this is around $15,000. So having seen this danger to the economy, I thought, we need to find a solution to this problem. Here's my approach to it all. If you look at the current situation, you have a thousand TED Talks. Each of those TED Talks has an average length of about 2,300 words. Now take this together, and you end up with 2.3 million words of TED Talks, which is about three Bibles-worth of content. (Laughter) The obvious question here is, does a TED Talk really need 2,300 words? Isn't there something shorter? I mean, if you have an idea worth spreading, surely you can put it into something shorter than 2,300 words. The only question is, how short can you get? What's the minimum amount of words you would need to do a TED Talk? While I was pondering this question, I came across this urban legend about Ernest Hemingway, who allegedly said that these six words here: ""For sale: baby shoes, never worn,"" were the best novel he had ever written. And I also encountered a project called Six-Word Memoirs where people were asked, take your whole life and please sum this up into six words, such as these here: ""Found true love, married someone else."" Or ""Living in existential vacuum; it sucks."" I actually like that one. So if a novel can be put into six words and a whole memoir can be put into six words, you don't need more than six words for a TED Talk. We could have been done by lunch here. (Laughter) And if you did this for all thousand TED Talks, you would get from 2.3 million words down to 6,000. So I thought this was quite worthwhile. So I started asking all my friends, please take your favorite TED Talk and put that into six words. So here are some of the results that I received. I think they're quite nice. For example, Dan Pink's talk on motivation, which was pretty good, if you haven't seen it: ""Drop carrot. Drop stick. Bring meaning."" It's what he's basically talking about in those 18,5 minutes. Or some even included references to the speakers, such as Nathan Myhrvold's speaking style, or the one of Tim Ferriss, which might be considered a bit strenuous at times. The challenge here is, if I try to systematically do this, I would probably end up with a lot of summaries, but not with many friends in the end. So I had to find a different method, preferably involving total strangers. And luckily, there's a website for that, called Mechanical Turk, which is a website where you can post tasks that you don't want to do yourself, such as ""Please summarize this text for me in six words."" And I didn't allow any low-cost countries to work on this, but I found out I could get a six-word summary for just 10 cents, which I think is a pretty good price. Even then, unfortunately, it's not possible to summarize each TED Talk individually. Because if you do the math, you have a thousand TED Talks, you pay 10 cents each; you have to do more than one summary for each of those talks, because some of them will probably be, or are, really bad. So I would end up paying hundreds of dollars. So I thought of a different way, by thinking, well, the talks revolve around certain themes. So what if I don't let people summarize individual TED Talks to six words, but give them 10 TED Talks at the same time and say, ""Please do a six-word summary for that one."" I would cut my costs by 90 percent. So for $60, I could summarize a thousand TED Talks into just 600 summaries, which would actually be quite nice. Some of you might actually right now be thinking, it's downright crazy to have 10 TED Talks summarized into just six words. But it's actually not, because there's an example by statistics professor Hans Rosling. I guess many of you have seen one or more of his talks. He's got eight talks online, and those can basically be summed up into just four words, because that's all he's basically showing us, our intuition is really bad. He always proves us wrong. So people on the Internet, some didn't do so well. And when I asked them to summarize the 10 TED Talks at the same time, some took the easy route out. They just had some general comment. There were others — and I found this quite cheeky — They used their six words to talk back to me and ask me if I'd been too much on Google lately. (Laughter) And finally also, I never understood this, some people really came up with their own version of the truth. I don't know any TED Talk that contains this. But, oh well. In the end, however, and this is really amazing, for each of those 10 TED Talk clusters that I submitted, I actually received meaningful summaries. Here are some of my favorites. For example, for the TED Talks about food, someone summed this up into: ""Food shaping body, brains and environment,"" which I think is pretty good. Or happiness: ""Striving toward happiness = moving toward unhappiness."" So here I was. I had started out with a thousand TED Talks and I had 600 six-word summaries for those. Actually, it sounded nice in the beginning, but when you look at 600 summaries, it's quite a lot, it's a huge list. (Laughter) So I thought, I probably have to take this one step further here and create summaries of the summaries, and this is exactly what I did. So I took the 600 summaries that I had, put them into nine groups according to the ratings that the talks had originally received on TED.com and asked people to do summaries of those. Again, there were some misunderstandings. For example, when I had a cluster of all the ""Beautiful"" talks, someone thought I was just trying to find the ultimate pick-up line. But in the end, amazingly, again, people were able to do it. For example, all the courageous TED Talks: ""People dying"" or ""People suffering"" was also one, ""with easy solutions around."" Or the recipe for the ultimate jaw-dropping TED Talk: ""Flickr photos of intergalactic classical composer."" I mean that's the essence of it all. Now I had my nine groups, but, I mean, it's already quite a reduction. But of course, once you are that far, you're not really satisfied. I wanted to go all the way, all the way down the distillery, starting out with a thousand TED Talks. I wanted to have a thousand TED Talks summarized into just six words — which would be a 99.9997 percent reduction in content. And I would only pay $99.50 — so stay even below $100 for it. So I had 50 overall summaries done. This time I paid 25 cents because I thought the task was a bit harder. And unfortunately, when I first received the answers — and here, you'll see six of the answers — I was a bit disappointed. Because I think you'll agree, they all summarize some aspect of TED, but to me, they felt a bit bland, or they just had a certain aspect of TED in them. So I was almost ready to give up when one night, I played around with these sentences and found out that there's actually a beautiful solution in here. So here it is, a crowd-sourced, six-word summary of a thousand TED Talks at the value of $99.50: ""Why the worry? I'd rather wonder."" Thank you very much. (Applause)"	目前TED網頁上有超過一千場演說我猜你們許多人認為這很棒我則不然，我完全不認為我認為我們有一個問題若你細想，一千場演說代表超過一千個值得分享的觀念到底你要如何散播一千個觀念就算你光要把這些觀念裝進你腦袋用看TED影片的方式目前要花你超過250個小時我稍微算了一下如果每個人都這麼做，對經濟的傷害約一萬五千美金知道這對經濟造成的危害後我認為我們需要一個解決的方法 以下是我一舉解決這問題的方法若你評估一下我們的現況我們有一千場TED演說每場演說平均長度約兩千三百字將全部加在一起你會得到兩百三十萬字的TED演說這字數相當於三本聖經的內容從這裡可以看出一個簡單的問題一場TED演說需要用到兩千三百字嗎?字數不能少一點嗎?若有值得散播的觀念那麼一定可以不必用到兩千三百字而問題是，字數可以少到什麼程度呢?到底可以用多少的字來能完成一場TED演說呢? 我在思索這個問題時我碰巧聽到關於海明威的傳言據說他說過這六個字「售：童鞋，全新的」是他寫過最好的小說了我也發現一個叫「六字回憶錄」的企劃參與的人被要求用六個字 為他們的人生做總結「真愛沒嫁我」或是「生命超空洞，爛」我其實還蠻喜歡這一個如果小說能被縮短成六個字而回憶錄也可以那麼TED演說不需要超過六個字我們其實中午就可以結束了我的意思是說若你把一千場TED演說都縮短成六個字原本的兩百三十萬就只剩下六千字了所以我覺得這很值得做 於是我開始請朋友幫忙我請他們把喜歡的TED演說用六個字道出這裡一些我得到的結果。我覺得它們還不錯舉例來說，丹‧平克關於激勵人心的演說那場還蠻棒的「不獎懲，講重點」而這基本上就是那演說18分半的重點有人甚至介紹了演講人參考的風格例如說：納森‧米洛的演說風格或是提姆‧法洛的演說風格若要這麼做，有時可能很費力 而困難就在於，若我有系統的這麼做雖然最後我會有很多六字摘要但朋友可能都跑光了於是我必須找別的方法最好能讓能叫陌生人參與的很幸運的是，有一個網站叫「機械工人」在這個網站，你可以發文請人幫忙來完成你不想自己動手做的工作例如說，請用六個字幫這份文章做摘要而且我不希望讓那些剝削勞工的國家參與而我發現，一份六字摘要的費用僅僅十美分我覺得這個價錢還蠻不錯的 但很不幸的，就算那樣要把每場TED演說做摘要還是一個不可能的任務我們來算一下好了，我們手上有一千場TED演說而每份摘要十美分而有時，同一場演說會有超過一份摘要因為有些演說的內容可能，不然就是真的很糟而這樣下來費用將是數百元於是我想了一個不同的方法因為TED演說都有特定的主題要是我不是叫人一次做一篇TED演說的摘要而是一次給他們十場TED演說並對他們說，「請用六個字為這十篇演說做一個摘要」那麼我的費用會減少九成這麼一來，60元就能買到一千場TED演說的摘要了也就是六百篇摘要這樣還蠻不錯的 我們當中可能有人覺得用六個字來為十場TED演說做摘要是很瘋狂的想法但其實不會而統計教授漢斯·羅斯林就是一個很好的例子我猜你們當中有許多人看過他的演說線上有八場他的演說而這八場演說其實可以用四個字做摘要因為基本上，他只是想告訴我們我們的直覺不準他總能證明我們錯了 但其實網路上面幫忙的人，有些表現的不是很好當我叫他們幫我把十篇TED演說做六字摘要時有些人偷懶就只給我一下很普通的評語當然也有一些人很機車他們用這六個字來消遣我並問我最近是不是太沉迷網路了當然也有人說的我一直都不懂因為這些人自己掰了一些大道理出來而TED演說中完全沒有這樣的內容 那我就算了。但最後很神奇的事情發生了我發文請人摘要的十場演說，每個都有人給我有意義的摘要以下是我最愛的幾個例如關於食物主題的TED演說有人的摘要是，「食物會塑造體態﹑頭腦和環境」我覺得這個很棒或是在幸福的主題中，「追求快樂結果就是自找不快樂」 結論就是我原本的一千場TED演說現在成了六百篇六字摘要原本感覺還不錯但我看了一下後，六百篇還蠻多的超長的於是我想更進一步的將他們縮短並幫這些摘要做摘要，而我也真的付諸實現我將手上的六百篇摘要分成九組依據他們在TED網站上原本得到的評分來分類並要求人們幫他們做摘要過程中有人誤會了摘要的目的例如其中一些精彩演說的摘要被誤會成是搭訕用的終極開場白但最後，很神氣的是人們又達到我的要求了例如關於勇氣的TED演說「人們被便利的方法害死了」或是「人們因為便利的方法而痛苦著」或是最令人驚艷的TED演說「跨銀河古典樂做曲家的網路相簿」而這其實就算這個演講的菁華了 現在我有九個類別的摘要雖然數量已經大幅消減了但都走到這一步了，你會覺得還意猶未盡我想說，要做就做的徹底原本手上的一千場TED演說我想將他們濃縮成一份六個字的摘要也就是刪除99.9997%的內容而費用僅99.5美金甚至不用花到100美元 我先做五十份摘要這次的費用是25分美金因為我覺得這次的工作比較困難不幸的是，當我收到結果時以下六個結果讓我有點失望我覺得你們看了也回失望，他們僅摘要出TED的部份特質但我覺得他們很乏味不然就是他們僅僅為TED的一個特質做摘要而當我正要放棄時有一個晚上我把玩著這些句子我發現一個很漂亮的解決方法也就是利用網路分工合作為一千場TED演說來做一份六字摘要而它價值99.5美金「何必擔憂?時候到了就知道了」 謝謝大家 【掌聲】
