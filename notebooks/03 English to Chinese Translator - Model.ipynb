    "To write a statistical English to Chinese translator, we will consider English sentences $e$ and Chinese sentences $c$. This may seem like solving the opposite problem, but given $c$, we seek the English sentence that will maximize $P( e \\mid  c)$ (that is, the most likely English sentence when given the Chinese sentence.) This reversal will be explained later. More formally, we are trying to find the english sentence $\\vec{e}$ that satisfies\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{e} = arg\\hspace{0.05cm} max\\hspace{0.05cm}P(e \\mid c)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we approach maximizing the probability $P(e \\mid  c)?$ Given that we know Bayes' Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P( e \\mid  c) = \\dfrac{P(e)\\hspace{0.05cm}P(c\\mid e)}{P(c)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "the above equation becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{e} = arg\\hspace{0.05cm} max\\hspace{0.05cm}P(e \\mid c) = arg\\hspace{0.05cm} max\\hspace{0.05cm}P(e)\\hspace{0.05cm}P(c \\mid e)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is pure Bayesian reasoning; think of the given Chinese sentence $c$ as a crime scene. Knight gives a good analogy for this: $e$ is the person who did the crime, $P(e)$ is the description of the person, and $P(c \\mid e)$ is how they did it. There are possibly many people who fit the description of $P(e)$ but those people may not have the means of committing the crime. Likewise, there are possibly many people who have the means $P(c \\mid e)$ of committing the crime but they don't fit the personality. We're trying to solve for the person who is most likely to commit the crime and has the means to commit it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we think about translating language itself, accurate syntax and translations are necessary. We can't have one without the other. In our last equation, $P(e)$ is equivalent to correct syntax and $P(c\\mid e)$ is equivalent to correct translations. This is why we must maximize the probability $P(e \\mid c)$. Maximizing this probability is equivalent to finding sentences that have correct syntax and accurate translations."
