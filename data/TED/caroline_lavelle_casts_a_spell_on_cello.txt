When I arrived off the plane, after a very long journey from the West of England, my computer, my beloved laptop, had gone mad, and had — oh! — a bit like that! — and the display on it — anyway, the whole thing had burst. And I went to the IT guys here and a gentleman mended my computer, and then he said, ""What are you doing here?"" and I said ""I'm playing the cello and I'm doing a bit of singing,"" and he said, ""Oh, I sort of play the cello as well."" And I said, ""Do you really?"" Anyway, so you're in for a treat, because he's fantastic, and his name's Mark. (Applause) I am also joined by my partner in crime, Thomas Dolby. (Applause) This song is called ""Farther than the Sun."" (Music) ♫ Strung in the wind I called you ♫ ♫ but you did not hear ... ♫ ♫ And you're a plant that needs poor soil ♫ ♫ and I have treated you too well ♫ ♫ to give up flowers ... ♫ ♫ Oh, I have been too rich for you ... ♫ ♫ Farther than the sun from me ♫ ♫ Farther than I'd have you be ♫ ♫ And I go north, I get so cold ♫ ♫ My heart is lava under stone ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ... ♫ ♫ With your calculating eyes ♫ ♫ spinning figures ♫ ♫ you cannot see me ♫ ♫ You cannot see me ... ♫ ♫ And if I tell myself enough ♫ ♫ I'll believe it ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ The sea, it freezes over ... ♫ ♫ to trap the light ♫ ♫ And I'm in love with being in love ♫ ♫ and you were never quite the one ♫ ♫ In Gerda's eyes ♫ ♫ Fragments of what you've become ♫ ♫ And all the moths that fly at night ♫ ♫ believe electric light is bright ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ With your calculating eyes ♫ ♫ Spinning figures ♫ ♫ You cannot see me, no ♫ ♫ And if I tell myself enough ♫ ♫ I'll believe it ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ Farther than the sun from me ♫ ♫ Farther than I'd have you be ♫ ♫ And I go north, I get so cold ♫ ♫ My heart is lava under stone ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ You are not worthy ♫ ♫ With your calculating eyes ♫ ♫ Spinning figures ♫ ♫ You cannot see me, no ... ♫ ♫ And if I tell myself enough, I'll believe it ♫ (Applause) Thank you very much."	非常感謝大家。我現在要跟你們說個故事，我從英國西部搭長途飛機抵達這邊，一下飛機後，我發現我的電腦，我親愛的筆記型電腦不能用了，然後，呼（背景碰一聲），就有點像這樣，還有電腦螢幕，總之，整台電腦都不能用了。所以，我就向這邊的電腦技術人員尋求協助，一位先生幫我修好了電腦，然後那位先生問我說：「你來這裡做什麼呀？」我說：「我來這邊拉大提琴，另外還會唱幾首歌。」然後他說：「喔！我也會拉一點大提琴耶。」然後，我就說：「真的嗎？」那你今天就來跟我一起表演吧！這位先生叫做馬克，他真的好棒！ （掌聲） 還有我的「共犯」，湯馬斯•多比。 （掌聲） 這首歌叫做《遙不可及》， （音樂） ♫ 我在風中呼喚你 ♫ ♫ 但你沒聽見 ♫ ♫ 你是個需要貧土的犁 ♫ ♫ 而我卻對你太好了 ♫ ♫ 總給你鮮花 ♫ ♫ 喔！我對你太慷慨了 ♫ ♫ 你對我來說，遙不可及 ♫ ♫ 比我心所欲的距離，還遠 ♫ ♫ 越向北走，我覺得越冷 ♫ ♫ 但我的心就像地底的熔岩 ♫ ♫ 你不值得 ♫ ♫ 你不值得 ♫ ♫ 你充滿算計的眼中 ♫ ♫ 只有利益 ♫ ♫ 你不在乎我 ♫ ♫ 你不在乎我 ♫ ♫ 如果我向自己說：『停吧。』 ♫ ♫ 我就會相信 ♫ ♫ 你不值得 ♫ ♫ 海凝結了 ♫ ♫ 為了捕捉光亮 ♫ ♫ 我沉浸在愛中 ♫ ♫ 但你卻不然 ♫ ♫ 在巨人葛達的眼中 ♫ ♫ 你是碎片 ♫ ♫ 夜裡的飛蛾 ♫ ♫ 被表象蒙蔽 ♫ ♫ 你不值得 ♫ ♫ 你不值得 ♫ ♫ 你充滿算計的眼中 ♫ ♫ 只有利益 ♫ ♫ 你不在乎我 ♫ ♫ 如果我向自己說：「停吧。」 ♫ ♫ 我就會相信 ♫ ♫你不值得 ♫ ♫ 你對我來說，遙不可及 ♫ ♫ 比我心所欲的距離，還遠 ♫ ♫ 越往北走，我覺得越冷 ♫ ♫ 但我的心就像地底的熔岩 ♫ ♫ 你不值得 ♫ ♫ 你不值得 ♫ ♫ 你充滿算計的眼中 ♫ ♫ 只有利益 ♫ ♫ 你不乎我，不在乎...... ♫ ♫ 如果我向自己說：「停吧。」 ♫ （掌聲） 謝謝大家。
