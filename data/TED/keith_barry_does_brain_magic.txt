keith_barry_does_brain_magic	"Brain magic. What's brain magic all about? Brain magic to me indicates that area of magic dealing with psychological and mind-reading effects. So unlike traditional magic, it uses the power of words, linguistic deception, non-verbal communication and various other techniques to create the illusion of a sixth sense. I'm going to show you all how easy it is to manipulate the human mind once you know how. I want everybody downstairs also to join in with me and everybody. I want everybody to put out your hands like this for me, first of all. OK, clap them together, once. OK, reverse your hands. Now, follow my actions exactly. Now about half the audience has their left hand up. Why is that? OK, swap them around, put your right hand up. Cross your hands over, so your right hand goes over, interlace your fingers like this, then make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb — that's very important. Yours is the other way around, so swap it around. Excellent, OK. Extend your fingers like this for me. All right. Tap them together once. OK, now, if you did not allow me to deceive your minds, you would all be able to do this. (Laughter) (Laughter ends) Now you can see how easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind, once you know how. (Laughter) Now, I remember when I was about 15, (Laughter) I read a copy of Life magazine, which detailed a story about a 75-year-old blind Russian woman who could sense printed letters — there's still people trying to do it — (Laughter) — who could sense printed letters and even sense colors, just by touch. And she was completely blind. She could also read the serial numbers on bills when they were placed, face down, on a hard surface. Now, I was fascinated, but at the same time, skeptical. How could somebody read using their fingertips? You know, if you actually think about it, if somebody is totally blind — a guy yesterday did a demonstration in one of the rooms, where people had to close their eyes and they could just hear things. And it's just a really weird thing to try and figure out. How could somebody read using their fingertips? Now earlier on, as part of a TV show that I have coming up on MTV, I attempted to give a similar demonstration of what is now known as second sight. So, let's take a look. (Video) Man: There we go. I'm going to guide you into the car. Kathryn Thomas: (Laughter) Man: You're OK, keep on going. KT: How are you? Keith Barry: Kathryn, it's Keith here. I'm going to take you to a secret location, OK? Kathryn, there was no way you could see through that blindfold. KT: OK, but don't say my name like that. KB: But you're OK? KT: Yes. KB: No way to see through it? KT: No. KB: I'll take it off. Do you want to take the rest off? Take it off, you're OK. We'll stop for a second. KT: I'm so afraid of what I'm going to see. KB: You're fine, take it off. You're OK. You're safe. Have you ever heard of second sight? KT: No. KB: Second sight is whereby a mind-control expert can see through somebody else's eyes. And I'm going to try that right now. KT: God. KB: Are you ready? Where is it? There's no way — KT: (Beep) KT: Oh, my God! KB: Don't say anything, I'm trying to see through your eyes. I can't see. KT: There's a wall, there's a wall. KB: Look at the road, look at the road. KT: OK, OK, OK. Oh, my God! KB: Now, anything coming at all? KT: No. KB: Sure there's not? KT: No, no, I'm just still looking at the road. I'm looking at the road, all the time. I'm not taking my eyes off the road. (Beep) (Beep) (Beep) KT: Oh, my God! KB: Where are we? Where are we? We're going uphill, are we going uphill? KT: Look at the road — (Beep) Still got that goddamn blindfold on. KB: What? KT: How are you doing this? KB: Just don't break my concentration. We're OK, though? KT: Yes. That's so weird. We're nearly there. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! KB: And I've stopped. KT: That is weird. You're like a freak-ass of nature. That was the most scary thing I've ever done in my life! (Applause) KB: Thank you. By the way, two days ago, we were going to film this down there, at the race course, and we got a guy into a car, and we got a camera man in the back, but halfway through the drive, he told me he had, I think it was a nine-millimeter, stuck to his leg. So, I stopped pretty quick, and that was it. So, do you believe it's possible to see through somebody else's eyes? That's the question. Now, most people here would automatically say no. OK, but I want you to realize some facts. I couldn't see through the blindfold. The car was not gimmicked or tricked in any way. The girl, I'd never met before, all right. So, I want you to just think about it for a moment. A lot of people try to come up with a logical solution to what just happened, all right. But because your brains are not trained in the art of deception, the solutions you come up with will, 99 percent of the time, be way off the mark. This is because magic is all about directing attention. If, for instance, I didn't want you to look at my right hand, then I don't look at it. But if I wanted you to look at my right hand, then I look at it, too. You see, it's very simple, once you know how, but very complicated in other ways. I'm going to give you some demonstrations right now. I need two people to help me out real quick. Can you come up? And let's see, down at the end, here, can you also come up, real quick? Do you mind? Yes, at the end. OK, give them a round of applause as they come up. You might want to use the stairs, there. (Applause) It's very important for everybody here to realize I haven't set anything up with you. You don't know what will happen, right? Would you mind just standing over here for a moment? Your name is? Nicole: Nicole. KB: Nicole, and? (Telephone ringing) KB: Actually, here's the thing, answer it, answer it, answer it. (Laughter) Is it a girl? Man: They've already gone. KB: OK, swap over positions. Can you stand over here? This will make it easier. Pity, I would have told them it was the ace of spades. OK, a little bit closer. (Laughter) OK, a little bit closer, come over — they look really nervous up here. Do you believe in witchcraft? Nicole: No. KB: Voodoo? Nicole: No. KB: Things that go bump in the night? Nicole: No. KB: Besides, who's next, no, OK. I want you to just stand exactly like this for me, pull up your sleeves, if you don't mind. OK, now, I want you to be aware of all the different sensations around you, because we'll try a voodoo experiment. I want you to be aware of the sensations, but don't say anything until I ask you, and don't open your eyes until I ask you. From this point onwards, close your eyes, do not say anything, do not open them, be aware of the sensations. Yes or no, did you feel anything? Nicole: Yes. KB: You did feel that? What did you feel? Nicole: A touch on my back. KB: How many times did you feel it? Nicole: Twice. KB: Twice. OK, extend your left arm out in front of you. Extend your left arm, OK. OK, keep it there. Be aware of the sensations, don't say anything, don't open your eyes, OK. Did you feel anything, there? Nicole: Yes. KB: What did you feel? Nicole: Three — KB: Like a tickling sensation? Nicole: Yes. KB: Can you show us where? OK, excellent. Open your eyes. I never touched you. I just touched his back, and I just touched his arm. A voodoo experiment. (Laughter) Yeah, I walk around nightclubs all night like this. (Laughter) You just take a seat over here for a second. I'm going to use you again, in a moment. Can you take a seat right over here, if you don't mind. Sit right here. Man: OK. KB: OK, take a seat. Excellent, OK. Now, what I want you to do is look directly at me, OK, just take a deep breath in through your nose, letting it out through your mouth, and relax. Allow your eyes to close, on five, four, three, two, one. Close your eyes right now. OK, now, I'm not hypnotizing you, I'm merely placing you in a heightened state of synchronicity, so our minds are along the same lines. And as you sink and drift and float into this relaxed state of mind, I'm going to take your left hand, and just place it up here. I want you to hold it there just for a moment, and I only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness, and allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop. That's it, all the way down, all the way down. and further, and further. Excellent. I want you to allow your hand to stick firmly to the tabletop. OK, now, allow it to stay there. OK, now, in a moment, you'll feel a certain pressure, OK, and I want you to be aware of the pressure. Just be aware of the pressure. And I only want you to allow your hand to float slowly back up from the tabletop as you feel the pressure release, but only when you feel the pressure release. Do you understand? Just answer yes or no. Man: Yes. KB: Hold it right there. And only when you feel the pressure go back, allow your hand to drift back to the tabletop, but only when you feel the pressure. (Laughter) OK, that was wonderfully done. Let's try it again. Excellent. Now that you've got the idea, let's try something even more interesting. Allow it to stick firmly to the tabletop, keep your eyes closed. Can you stand up? Just stand, stage forward. I want you to point directly at his forehead. OK. Imagine a connection between you and him. Only when you want the pressure to be released, make an upward gesture, like this, but only when you want it to be released. You can wait as long as you want, but only when you want the pressure released. OK, let's try it again. OK, now, imagine the connection, OK. Point directly at his forehead. Only when you want the pressure released, we'll try it again. OK, it worked that time, excellent. And hold it there, both of you. Only when you want the pressure to go back, make a downward gesture. You can wait as long as you want. You did it pretty quickly, but it went down, OK. Now, I want you to be aware that in a moment, when I snap my fingers, your eyes will open, again. It's OK to remember to forget, or forget to remember what happened. Most people ask you, ""What the hell just happened up here?"" But it's OK that even though you're not hypnotized, you will forget everything that happened. On five, four, three, two, one — open your eyes, wide awake. Give them a round of applause, as they go back to their seats. (Applause) OK, you can go back. (Applause) I once saw a film called ""The Gods Are Crazy."" Has anybody here seen that film? Yeah. Remember when they threw the Coke out of the airplane, and it landed on the ground, and it didn't break? Now, see, that's because Coke bottles are solid. It's nearly impossible to break a Coke bottle. Do you want to try it? Good job. She's not taking any chances. (Laughter) You see, psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes. For some magicians or mentalists, sometimes the spoon will bend or melt, sometimes it will not. Sometimes the object will slide across the table, sometimes it will not. It depends on how much energy you have that day, so on and so forth. We're going to try an experiment in psychokinesis, right now. Come right over here, next to me. Excellent. Now, have a look at the Coke bottle. Make sure it is solid, there's only one hole, and it's a normal Coke bottle. And you can whack it against the table, if you want; be careful. Even though it's solid, I'm standing away. I want you to pinch right here with two fingers and your thumb. Excellent. Now, I've got a shard of glass here, OK. I want you to examine the shard of glass. Careful, it's sharp. Just hold on to it for a moment. Now, hold it out here. I want you to imagine, right now, a broken relationship from many years ago. I want you to imagine all the negative energy from that broken relationship, from that guy, being imparted into the broken piece of glass, which will represent him, OK. But I want you to take this very seriously. Stare at the glass, ignore everybody right here. In a moment, you'll feel a certain sensation, OK, and when you feel that sensation, I want you to drop the piece of glass into the bottle. Think of that guy, that ba — that guy. (Laughter) I'm trying to be good here. OK, and when you feel the sensation — it might take a while — drop it into the glass. OK, drop it in. Now, imagine all that negative energy in there. Imagine his name and imagine him inside the glass. And I want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side. (Burst) (Laughter) That was a lot of negative energy, built up in there. (Laughter) (Applause) I also want you to look at me and think of his name. OK, think of how many letters in the title of his name. There's five letters in the title. You didn't react to that, so it's four letters. Think of one of the letters in the title. There's a K in his name, there is a K. I knew that because my name starts with a K also, but his name doesn't start with a K, it starts with an M. Tell Mike I said hello, the next time you see him. Was that his name? Nicole: Mm-hmm. KB: OK, give her a round of applause. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) (Applause ends) I've got one more thing to share with you right now. Actually, Chris, I was going to pick you for this, but instead of picking you, can you hop up here and pick a victim for this next experiment? And it should be a male victim, that's the only thing. Chris Anderson: Oh, OK. KB: I was going to use you, but I decided I might want to come back another year. (Laughter) CA: Well, to reward him for saying ""eureka,"" and for selecting Michael Mercil to come and talk to us — Steve Jurvetson. KB: OK, Steve, come on up here. (Applause) CA: You knew! KB: OK, Steve, I want you to take a seat, right behind here. Excellent. Now, Steve — oh, you can check underneath. Go ahead, I've no fancy assistants underneath there. They insist that because I was a magician, put a nice, black tablecloth on. There you are, OK. (Laughter) I've got four wooden plinths here, Steve. One, two, three and four. Now, they're all the exact same except this one obviously has a stainless steel spike sticking out of it. I want you to examine it, and make sure it's solid. Happy? Steve Jurvetson: Mmm, yes. KB: OK. Now, Steve, I'm going to stand in front of the table, When I stand in front of the table, I want you to put the cups on the plinths, in any order you want, and then mix them all up, so nobody has any idea where the spike is, all right? SJ: No one in the audience? KB: Yes, and just to help you out, I'll block them from view, so nobody can see what you're doing. I'll also look away. So, go ahead and mix them up, now. OK, and tell me when you're done. (Laughter) (Laughter) KB: You done? SJ: Almost. KB: Almost, oh. OK, you're making sure that's well hidden. Oh, we've got one here, we've got one here. (Applause) So, all right, we'll leave them like that. (Laughter) I'm going to have the last laugh, though. (Laughter) Now, Steve, you know where the spike is, but nobody else, does? Correct? But I don't want you to know either, so swivel around on your chair. They'll keep an eye on me to make sure I don't do anything funny. No, stay around, OK. Now, Steve, look back. Now you don't know where the spike is, and I don't know where it is either. Now, is there any way to see through this blindfold? SJ: Put this on? KB: No, just, is there any way to see through it? No? SJ: No, I can't see through it. KB: Excellent. Now, I'm going to put on the blindfold. Don't stack them up, OK. Give them an extra mix up. Don't move the cups, I don't want anybody to see where the spike is, but give the plinths an extra mix up, and then line them up. I'll put the blindfold on. Give them an extra mix up. No messing around this time. OK, go ahead, mix them up. My hand is at risk here. (Laughter) Tell me when you're done. SJ: Done. KB: OK, where are you? Put out your hand. Your right hand. Tell me when I'm over a cup. SJ: You're over a cup. KB: I'm over a cup, right now? SJ: Mm-hmm. KB: Now, Steve, do you think it's here? Yes or no? SJ: Oh! (Laughter) KB: I told you I'd have the last laugh. (Laughter) SJ: I don't think it's there. KB: No? Good decision. (Laughter) (Applause) (Applause ends) Now, if I go this way, is there another cup over here? SJ: Can we do the left hand? KB: Oh, no, no, no. He asked me could he do the left hand. Absolutely not. (Laughter) KB: If I go this way, is there another cup? SJ: Yes. KB: Tell me when to stop. SJ: OK. KB: There? SJ: Yes, there's one. KB: OK. Do you think it's here, yes or no? This is your decision, not mine. (Laughter) SJ: I'm going to say no. KB: Good decision. (Laughter) OK, give me both hands. Now, put them on both cups. Do you think the spike is under your left or your right hand? SJ: Neither. KB: Neither, oh, OK. But if you were to guess. (Laughter) SJ: Under my right hand. KB: Under your right hand? Now, remember, you made all the decisions all along. Psychologists, figure this out. (SJ gasps) Have a look. SJ: Oh! (Applause) KB: Thank you. (Applause ends) If anybody wants to see some sleight of hand later on, I'll be outside. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)"	腦力魔術。究竟什麼是腦力魔術？對我來說腦力魔術指示出對於魔術的範圍是與心靈產生聯繫以及心智讀取作用。所以與傳統魔術不同，它使用的是語言的力量。語言學的騙局，沒有語言的溝通與各式各樣的技巧來產生第六感的幻覺 現在，我要讓大家看看操縱人類的大腦有多麼容易，一旦你能一窺堂奧。我希望在座及樓下的每一位來賓能跟我一起活動一下。首先，請大家像這樣伸出你們的手。好，拍手一次。好，反轉你們的手。接下來確實的跟著我的動作。大約有一半的人舉起來的是左手，那ㄟ阿ㄋㄟ(台語, =為什麼)？好，交換過來，右手在上。好，再來，將雙手交叉讓你的右手越過左手。像這樣十指反扣交疊 ，然後確認一下你的右手拇指在左手拇指的外面…這很重要。你們的是另一邊的反方向，所以要換過來。太棒了，好。伸出你們的食指，像這樣。對~了，輕輕碰一下。好，現在，如果你沒有允許我蒙蔽了你的心智。你們就一定可以像這樣做。（哄堂大笑）你看到了吧！要操縱人類的大腦是多麼容易，一旦你能了解箇中奧妙。（哄堂大笑） 我現在想起大約在我15歲的時候…我讀過一本生活雜誌的複本，詳細的描述有關一位75歲的俄羅斯眼盲老太太可以辨識印刷的文字…還有些人在試 嗯~（哄堂大笑）她只藉由觸摸，就可以辨識印刷的文字甚至還可以辨別顏色。而她是全盲。她還可以讀出反放在堅硬平面上單據中的一連串數字。當時，我覺得很不可思議卻也無法相信。怎麼有人可以用手指閱讀？你想想，如果你認真的思考，一個已經全盲的人…昨天有個人在一個地方論證此事在那裡的人必須閉著眼睛，只能用耳朵聽。會想要對這種事做嘗試和更深入了解真的很奇怪，怎麼有人可以用手指閱讀？之前在電視中曾經播放過一段我的MTV，我嘗試對傳說中的『第三隻眼』作類似的驗證。那我們來看一下吧。 （影片）男人：我們過去吧！我會引導妳上車。 Kathryn：（大笑） 男人：你別擔心，繼續往前走。 Kathryn：你好嗎？ Keith Barry: 凱薩琳(Kathryn)，我是基斯(Keith)，我要帶你到一個秘密的地點好嗎？ KB: 凱薩琳，現在你完全無法透過這眼罩看到任何東西。 Kathryn: 好，但是不要那樣叫我的名子。 KB: 好，但你是看不到的，對嗎？ Kathryn: 是的。 KB: 你完全無法透過它看到任何東西，是嗎？ Kathryn: 對。 KB: 好，我現在要將它拿下來，你沒事，你沒問題。你願意將另一部分也拿下來嗎。儘管拿下來，沒關係。我們只是暫停一下。 Kathryn: 我很怕不知道會看到啥。 KB: 不會，不會，不會有事，沒關係的，拿掉它。你很好，很安全。你有沒有聽過『第三隻眼』？ Kathryn: 沒有。 KB: 『第三隻眼』是由心靈控制專家藉由他人的眼觀察。而我現在正要做這項嘗試。 Kathryn: 天啊！ KB: 你準備好了嗎？這是哪？前面沒路... Kathryn: 嗶 -♪（消音）哦，天啊！ KB: 噓—不要說話我正嘗試用你的眼睛來看。我看不到。 Kathryn: 前面有一道牆，前面有一道牆。 KB: 看路，看路。 Kathryn: 好，好，好。噢，我的天啊！ KB: 有啥靠過來嗎？ Kathryn: 沒，沒，沒，都沒有。 KB: 確定沒有嗎？ Kathryn: 沒有，沒有，我都有在看路。一直都在看路。我的眼睛沒離開過路面。嗶 -♪（消音）嗶-♪（消音）嗶-♪（消音）噢，我的天啊！ KB: 我們在哪？我們在哪？我們在上坡，我們在上坡嗎？ Kathryn: 看路…嗶—（消音）還戴著那天殺的眼罩。 KB: 什麼？ Kathryn: 你這樣行嗎？ KB: 別分散我的注意力就行。KB: 我們很好，對吧？ Kathryn: 對。這超怪異。我們快到了。厚，我的天啊！厚，我的老天爺啊！ KB: 我得停下來。 Kathryn: 那很怪異。你活像個天生怪咖。那是我這輩子做過最可怕的事。 （熱烈鼓掌） 謝謝大家！對了，兩天前，在前方的跑道我們打算拍攝這支影片我們還邀請一位男士上車，後座有一位攝影師車才開到半路，他說他有…我想大約有個9毫米的什麼東東，刺到他的大腿。所以我很快的煞車，就這樣。 所以，你們覺得透過別人的眼睛看東西是可能的嗎？那是個問題。也許大部分在場的人會直覺說不可能。好，不過我希望你們能明白一些事戴著眼罩我完全看不到。那輛車沒有裝任何機關也沒動過手腳，我從沒見過那女孩，好嗎。我請大家稍微往另一面思考大部分人開始想以邏輯解答剛才發生的事，沒關係。只是各位的頭腦並未受過騙局技巧的訓練，你想出來的答案有99％一定會偏離重點。 這是因為魔術都是『注意力導引』。舉例，我不要你看我的右手。當然，我也不去看它。然而如果我希望你看著我的右手，然後我也會看著它，你們看。它真的超簡單，只要你知道方法。不過，也有其複雜的一面。 現在我來做幾項示範，現場的，就現在。我需要2個人能很快出來幫我的忙。你可以上來嗎？我們再看看，角落那位，這裡，你也可以迅速上來嗎？你介意嗎？是的，最後那位。好，他們上台時請給予熱烈的掌聲。你可以爬樓梯上來，那裡。（熱烈鼓掌）現在，讓在場的每一位了解這很重要你們身上並沒有任何裝備。你們並不知道再來要做什麼。同意嗎？好，請你站在這邊一會兒好嗎？妳的名子是？ Nicole(妮可): 妮可。 KB: 妮可，以及？（手機正好在響） KB: 好，喔。回答他，其實可以這樣，接起來，接起來，接起來。（哄堂大笑） KB: 是個女孩嗎？ 男人：電話掛了。 KB: 喔，掛了，那好吧。告訴你我們要做什麼，來位置換一下。請你站過來這裡，這樣容易點。喔，那真可惜，我本來想告訴他們那是一張王牌。好，靠近一點。（哄堂大笑）靠近一點。（哄堂大笑）好，靠近一點。過來…他們在台上看起來很緊張。過來…靠近一點。 好，你相信巫術嗎？ Nicole：不信 KB: 巫毒？ Nicole：不信 KB: 晚上突然冒出來的玩意兒？ Nicole：不信。 KB: 除此以外，有其他人嗎？沒有，好。我要你像這樣站好，把袖子捲起來，如果你不介意。好，現在，我要你用心覺察你周圍所有感官的變化，因為我們現再要做一項巫毒試驗。我要你儘可能注意你的感官，但是什麼也別說直到我問你，也別張開眼睛直到我說可以。在這之前，請閉起妳的眼睛，不要說話，也不要睜眼，注意你的感官意識。 可以嗎？你有沒有任何感覺？ Nicole：有。 KB: 你有感覺到？什麼樣的感覺？ Nicole：我的背有被碰到的感覺。 KB: 被碰幾次？ Nicole：2次。 KB：2次。很好，請往前伸展你的左手臂。伸展你的左手臂，好。好，保持這個動作注意你的感官，不要說話，也別張開眼睛，好。你有沒有任何感覺？ Nicole：有。 KB: 你有什麼感覺？ Nicole：3次... KB: 類似搔癢的感覺？ Nicole：是的。 KB: 你可以讓我們知道在哪個位置嗎？好，很好。張開眼睛。我從未碰你。我碰的是他的背和他的手臂。一項巫毒試驗（哄堂大笑）是的，我在夜店走動整晚都有這感覺。（哄堂大笑）請坐到那個位子等一下。我待會兒還要用你。可以的話，請你到這裡坐下來。坐在這裡。 男人：好。 KB：好，請坐。太棒了，好。現在，我要你注意看著我，好，以鼻腔深吸一口空氣，再由嘴巴吐氣，然後放鬆。任由你的眼睛閉上，開始5,4,3,2,1…現在閉上你的眼睛。好，我現在不是在對你催眠，我只是將你的精神層次提高到與我同步的位置。如此你我的思維可以在同一個範圍中。你開始下沉然後漂流再上昇進入這個放鬆的思維空間，我會將你的左手提上來大約到這裡。 請你停在那裡一會兒，我只要你讓你的手下沉及漂流及上昇再回到桌面以相同的速率這飄昇讓你感受到放鬆的狀態，而且容許它直接下來到桌面。就這樣，放下來，放下來，放下來，再來，再來，再來，再來，再來，再來。很好。請讓你的手固定在桌上。好，現在，讓他待著。好，現在，過一會兒，你會感到一股明顯的壓力，好，而我要你注意這股壓力。專心感覺這股壓力。你只要任由你的手輕輕飄回桌面當你不再感到有壓力，只有在你感到壓力被釋放後。明白嗎？你只要回答是或不是你明白嗎？ 男人：是。 KB: 保持在那兒。好，當你再感覺到有壓力時，才讓你的手沉回到桌面，只有在你感覺到力量時。（哄堂大笑）好，表演的太精彩了，讓我們再試一次。 太棒了！你現在知道該怎麼做了。讓我們做些更有趣的嘗試。讓它固定在桌上，眼睛繼續閉著。可以請妳站起來嗎？好，就站在舞台前方。請妳指著他的前額，好。想像妳和他之間有一到連線，只有在妳想釋放那壓力時，做一個像上台起的姿勢，像這樣，而只有在妳願意釋放那股壓力時。妳想等多久都可以但是只有在妳希望那股壓力被釋放。好，我們再試試。好，開始想像那連結，好。指向他的前額。只有在妳希望那股壓力被釋放，我們再試一次。好，他當時行得通，很好。就保持在那兒，就醬，2位，就醬，只有當妳想再加壓時，做向下的手勢。妳想等多久都可以。妳速度很快，不過正往下，好。 線在我要你專注在那兒一會兒，當我彈手指時，你就張開眼睛，再來。要記得要忘記都可以，或是忘記剛發生的一切。不管多少人問起你剛剛在這裡所發生的事？就算你不是被催眠，你會忘記發生的一切。（哄堂大笑）5、4、3、2、1...張開眼睛，醒過來。在他們回座位時，請給予熱烈的掌聲。（熱烈鼓掌）好了，請回座。 我曾經看過一部電影叫《上帝也瘋狂》。有人看過這部電影嗎？對，對，對。（熱烈鼓掌）你還記得當他們將可樂瓶丟出飛機外，他掉在地面而且並沒有破掉。你們知道，那是因為可樂瓶很堅硬。要打破可樂瓶幾乎是不可能的你想試試看嗎？做得好。（哄堂大笑）她直接放棄了。 你看，相信的力量對身體產生超自然的影響力。對於一些魔術師或超感應異能者有時候能彎曲或融化湯匙，有時不行。有時候物體會滑過桌面，有時不行。那要取決於你所擁有的能量，大概就是這樣。我們現在要來做一項意志力的實驗。請過來站在我旁邊。太好了！ 現在，看著可樂瓶。確定一下他是堅硬的，它只有一個開口，是個一般的可樂瓶。如果你要的話，你可以拿她用力在桌上敲。小心！它非常的堅硬，我還是站遠一點好。好，請用三隻手指頭捏住這裡。太好了！現在，我拿著一片尖銳的玻璃，好。我要你檢查一下這片尖銳的玻璃。小心！因為它很銳利現在，抓著這裡。 現在請你想像一下，多年前一段破碎的關係。我要你想像所有的負面能量。來自於那段破碎的關係，以及那個傢伙。將它傳送給那片碎玻璃它將會代表他。不過我要你拿出非常嚴肅的態度盯著玻璃，不要理會在場的人。不久你就會有所感應，好。當你感應到時，我要你將這片玻璃丟進瓶子裡。想著那傢伙，那個渾...那個傢伙，（哄堂大笑）我很乖，真的。好，當你有所感應...可能要等一下...將它丟進玻璃瓶。好，丟進去。 現在，想像所有負面能量在裡面。想著他和他的名子在瓶子裡。我要你藉著兩邊搖晃來釋放那些負面能量。（哄堂大笑）這算是負面能量加強版。（哄堂大笑）（熱烈鼓掌）我還要你也想一下他的名子。看著我想著他的名子。有想著他的名子嗎？好，想著他的名子有幾個字母。想一下有5個字母。沒有那麼多，所以是4個字母想著名子中的一個字母。想著其中一個字母。他的名子當中有一個字母K，有一個K。我怎麼知道，因為我的名子也是K開頭的，但他的名字不是K開頭的，是M開頭的。下次你見到Mike的時候替我問個好。這是他的名字嗎？ Nicole：嗯~嗯~KB：好了，請給她掌聲鼓勵。（熱烈鼓掌）謝謝你！（熱烈鼓掌）我還有一件事要與大家分享。事實上，Chris，我本來要請你來參與，不過與其請你參與，能請你跳上來這裡為下一個實驗挑選一個受害者嗎？而且必須是一位男性，這是唯一的條件。 喔！好。 KB： 我本來要請你來參與，但我想明年也許還會再回來。（哄堂大笑） 很好，為了獎勵他說『我發現了！』以及挑選Michael Mercil來演講的人—-Steve Jurvetson。 好，Steve，快點上來。（熱烈鼓掌） 你知道！ 好，Steve，我要你坐下來，就在後面，好極了現在，Steve—你可以檢查桌子下面。盡量看，這下面沒有精緻的設備他們會這麼認為，是因為我是個魔術師，放一條美美的黑色桌巾。給你，好。（哄堂大笑）我這裡有四塊木頭底座，史提夫。1、2、3還有4。現在，他們全部一模一樣，除了這一個很明顯的這一個有釘一根不銹鋼長釘我要你檢查它，並確定它的堅固。滿意嗎？ 嗯~ 是的。 好，現在，史提夫，我要去站在桌子前面，好，當我站在桌子前面的時候，我要你把這些杯子放在底座上，像這樣，任何順序都可以，然後混合他們，所以沒有人知道釘子在哪一個裡面，對嗎？觀眾裡也沒有人知道？ 觀眾裡沒人能幫助你，我會遮住他們的視線，所以沒有人能看見你在做什麼。我也不看，所以，盡量混合他們，現在。好，你完成後告訴我（笑聲）你好了嗎？ 嗯~快好了。 快了，噢！好，你要確定有藏好了，現在—噢！這裡有一個，這裡有一個（熱烈鼓掌）所以，就這樣，就讓他們像這樣。（哄堂大笑）到最後會笑的人是我。（哄堂大笑）現在，史提夫(Steve)，你知道釘子在哪裡，沒有其他人知道，對嗎？可是我也不想要你知道，所以將你的椅子轉向。他們一定會注意並確定我沒有做出什麼好笑的事，不，繼續轉，好。現在，史提夫，轉回來。所以，現在你不知道釘子在哪裡，我也不知道在哪裡，好。現在，有可能看透這個眼罩嗎？ SJ: 把它戴上？ KB: 不，只是看能否透視它？ SJ：嗯-嗯- KB：不可以？ SJ：不，我無法看透它 KB：你完全無法看透它，好。現在，我要戴上眼罩。別把它們堆起來，好。再混合它們一次。不要動杯子，因為我不想讓任何人知道釘子在哪裡，底座再混合一次。然後將它們排成一排，像這樣，對嗎？我要戴上眼罩。再混合它們一次。這次不能亂來。好，再來混合它們。我的手還活著，在這，所以—好險。（哄堂大笑）好了就告訴我。 好了。 好，你在哪裡？把你的手神出來。你的右手。在那兒—不對，好。當我到了杯子上方提醒我。 SJ: 你到了。 KB: 我在杯子上方，現在？ SJ: 嗯-嗯- KB: 現在，史提夫，你覺得是這裡嗎？是或不是？ SJ: 噢！（哄堂大笑） KB: 我說過到最後會笑的人是我（哄堂大笑） SJ: 我不認為在那哩。 KB: 不是？決定的好。（哄堂大笑）（熱烈鼓掌）現在，如我我往這個方向會有另一個杯子嗎？SJ: 我們可以換成左手嗎？ KB: 噢！不，不，不，他問我可不可以換成左手。門兒都沒有。（哄堂大笑） KB: 現在，如我我往這個方向會有另一個杯子嗎？ SJ: 那個方向有個杯子，對。 KB: 好，告訴我啥時停。 SJ: 好。 KB: 那裡嗎？ SJ: 對，那裡有一個。 KB: 你覺得是這裡嗎？是或不是？這是你的選擇，不是我的。（哄堂大笑） SJ: 我要說不是。 KB: 決定得好。（哄堂大笑）好，兩手都給我。現在，把它們放在兩個杯子上。你覺得釘子在你的左手下面，或是在你的右手下面？ SJ: 呃，都沒有。 KB: 都沒有，噢，好。不過如果你一定要猜呢？（哄堂大笑） SJ: 我想應該在我的右手下面。KB: 你認為在你的右手下面嗎？記得所有的決定都是你的。心理學家們，想出了這一切。看好。 SJ: 噢！（熱烈鼓掌）謝謝大家！ 謝謝大家！等一下如果有人想要看其他的戲法，我會在外面。謝謝大家！（熱烈鼓掌）謝謝大家！ 謝謝大家！（熱烈鼓掌）
