rory_bremner_s_one_man_world_summit	"Chris has been so nice. I don't know how you keep it up, Chris, I really don't. So nice, all week. He's the kind of man you could say to, ""Chris, I'm really sorry, I've crashed your car. And it gets worse, I crashed it into your house. Your house has caught fire. And what's more, your wife has just run off with your best friend."" And you know that Chris would say, ""Thank you."" (Laughter) ""Thank you for sharing, that's really interesting."" (Laughter) ""Thank you for taking me to a place that I didn't know existed. Thank you."" (Laughter) One of the — (Applause) Thank you for inviting us. One of the things about appearing later on in the TED week is that, gradually, as the days go by, all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say. (Laughter) Nuclear fusion, I had about 10 minutes on that. Spectroscopy, that was another one. Parallel universes. And so this morning I thought, ""Oh well, I'll just do a card trick."" (Laughter) That one's gone as well. And today is Emmanuel's day, I think we've agreed that, already, haven't we? Emmanuel? Absolutely. (Applause) I was planning on finishing on a dance ... (Laughter) So, that's going to look pretty shabby now. So, what I thought I'd do is — in honor of Emmanuel — is, what I can do is to launch today the first TED Global auction. If I could start, this is the Enigma decoding machine. (Laughter) Who will start me with $1,000? Anyone? Thank you. Bruno's face, just then, he said, ""No, don't go through this. Don't, please don't. Don't go through this. Don't do it."" (Laughter) I'm worried. When I first got the invitation, they said somewhere in the thing, they said, ""15 minutes to change the world, your moment onstage."" 15 minutes to change the world. I don't know about you, it takes me 15 minutes to change a plug. (Laughter) So, the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one. Well, of course now we know we don't have to change a plug, now we've seen that wonderful demonstration of the wireless electric — fantastic. You know, it inspires us. 300 years ago he'd have been burnt at the stake for that. (Laughter) And now it's an idea. (Laughter) It's great. It's fantastic. But you do meet some fantastic people, people who look at the world in a totally different way. Yesterday, David Deutsch, another one who covered most of what I was going to say. (Laughter) But when you think of the world in that way, it does make going to Starbucks a whole new experience, don't you think? I mean, he must walk in and they will say, ""Would you like a macchiato, or a latte, or an Americano, or a cappuccino?"" And he'll say, ""You're offering me things that are infinitely variable."" (Laughter) ""How can your coffee be true?"" (Laughter) And they will say, ""Would you mind if I serve the next customer?"" (Laughter) And Elaine Morgan yesterday, wasn't she wonderful? Fantastic. Really good. Her talk about the aquatic ape, and the link, of course, the link between Darwinism and the fact that we are all naked beneath this — we're not hirsute and we can swim rather well. And she said, you know, she's 90. She's running out of time, she said. And she's desperate to find more evidence for the link. And I think, ""I'm sitting next to Lewis Pugh."" (Laughter) This man has swum around the North Pole, what more evidence do you want? (Laughter) And there he is. (Applause) That's how TED brings these connections together. I wasn't here on Tuesday. I didn't actually see Gordon Brown's job application — um, sorry. (Laughter) I'm so sorry. (Applause) I'm so sorry. No, no. (Applause) No, no, ahh ... (Applause) (As Brown): ""Global problems require Scottish solutions."" (Laughter) The problem I have is because Gordon Brown, he comes onstage and he looks for all the world like a man who's just taken the head off a bear suit. (As Brown): ""Hello, can I tell you what happened in the woods back there? Uh, no."" (Laughter) ""I'm sorry. I've only got 18 minutes, 18 minutes to talk about saving the world, saving the planet, global institutions. Our work on climate change, I've only got 18 minutes, unfortunately I'm not able to tell you about all the wonderful things we're doing to promote the climate change agenda in Great Britain, like the third runway we're planning at Heathrow Airport ..."" (Laughter) ""The large coal-fired power station we're building at King's North, and of course the exciting news that only today, only this week, Britain's only manufacturer of wind turbines has been forced to close. No time, unfortunately, to mention those."" (Applause) ""British jobs for Scottish people ... No."" (Laughter) ""Christian principles, Christian values. Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife."" (Laughter) ""Although to be honest, when I was at Number 11 that was never going to be a problem."" (Laughter) (As Tony Blair): ""Yeah, alright, come on, eh. Alright Gordon, come on, eh. I just, can I just say a few things about, first about Cherie, because she's a wonderful lady, my wife, with a wonderful smile. That reminds me, I must post that letter."" (Laughter) ""I just think, you know, what people forget, Gordon and I, we always got on perfectly well. Alright, it was never exactly 'Brokeback Mountain.'"" (Laughter) ""You know, I wrote to him, just before I left office. I said, 'Can I rely on your support for the next month?' And he wrote back. He said, 'No, you can't.' Which kind of surprised me, because I'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before."" (Laughter) Another thing Gordon could have mentioned in his speech to the Mansion House in 2002 — that was to the building; the people weren't listening. But the people, when talking about the finance industry, he said, ""What you as the city of London have done for financial services, we, as a government, hope to do for the economy as a whole."" (Laughter) When you think what's happened to financial services, and you see what's happened to the economy, you think, ""Well, there is a man who delivers on his promises."" (Laughter) But we're in a new world now. We're in a completely new world. This is the first time that I can remember, where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan, you don't know if you're borrowing money from him, or if he's borrowing money from you. Am I right? These extraordinary things, Icelandic Internet accounts. Did anyone here have an Icelandic Internet account? Why would you do that? Why would — It's like one step up from replying to one of those emails from Nigeria, isn't it? (Laughter) Asking for your bank details. And, you know, Iceland, it was never going to cut it. It didn't have that kind of collateral. What does it have? It has fish, that's all. That's why the Prime Minister went on television. He said, ""This has left us all with a very big haddock."" (Laughter) A lot of what I do — I have to try and make sense of things before I can make nonsense of them. And making sense of the financial crisis is very, very difficult. Luckily, somebody like George Bush was really helpful. He summed it up, really, at a dinner. He was speaking at a dinner, he said, ""Wall Street got drunk."" (Laughter) ""And now it's got a hangover."" And that's, you know, that's something — (Applause) And that's something we can relate to. It's certainly something he can relate to. (Laughter) And the other one, of course, is Donald Rumsfeld, who said, ""There are the known knowns, the things we know we know. And then you got the known unknowns, the things we know we don't know. And then you got the unknown unknowns, those are the things we don't know we don't know."" And being English, when I first heard that I thought, ""What a load of cock."" And then, you're now, well, actually, that's what this is about. This whole, what Ben Bernanke has said, the chaotic unwinding of the world's financial system, it's about — they don't know, they didn't know what they were doing. In 2006, the head of the American Mortgage Bankers Association said, quote, ""As we can clearly see, no seismic occurrence is about to overwhelm the U.S. economy."" Now, there is a man on top of his job. (Laughter) And when the crisis was happening, the head of quantitative equities at Lehman Brothers said, ""Events which models predicted would happen once every 10,000 years happened every day for three days."" So, it's extraordinary. It's a new world that's very, very difficult to make sense of. But we have a new hope. We have a new man. America has now elected its first openly black President. (Laughter) Wonderful news. Not only that, he's left-handed. Have you noticed this? How many people here are left-handed? You see, a lot of the people that I most admire, they're great artists, great designers, great thinkers, they're left-handed. And somebody said to me last night, you know, being left-handed, you have to learn to write without smudging the ink. And somebody was talking about metaphors on Monday. And I thought, what a wonderful metaphor, isn't it? An American President who has to write without smudging the ink. You like that one? As opposed to you could see George Bush, well, what's the metaphor there? I think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing, wouldn't it? ""Well, you know I'm sorry about that. I'm right-handed but I seem to have smudged that ink as well."" (Laughter) But, you know, he's gone. Now he's gone. That's eight years of American History, eight minutes of my act, just gone like that. ""You know, it's the end of an error [sic]. I happen to believe it was a great error. I know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors in the history of the United States. But we proved them wrong in Iraq. They said there was no link between Iraq and Al Qaeda. There is now."" (Laughter) ""But I have a message for the suicide bombers, for those people who've blown themselves up."" (Laughter) ""We're going to find you."" (Laughter) ""We're going to make sure you don't do it again."" (Laughter) But now he's gone, and it's great to see one of the — arguably one of the worst speech makers in American history, now given way to one of the greatest, in Obama. You were there, maybe, on the night of his victory. And he spoke to the crowd in Chicago, he said, ""If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible ..."" I can't do the whole thing because it would take too long, it really would. (Laughter) But you get the picture. And then it goes to the inauguration. And he and the Chief Justice, they trip over each other, they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up. And there is George Bush sitting there going, ""Heh heh heh heh ..."" (Laughter) ""Not so easy is it? Heh heh heh."" (Laughter) But the interesting thing is, Gordon Brown was talking about Cicero, who said, people would listen to a speech, they said, ""Great speech."" And then they'd listen to Demosthenes, and they'd say, ""Let's march."" And we all want to believe in President Obama. It's rather like that line in the film ""As Good As it Gets."" Do you remember that film with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson, and Helen Hunt says to Jack Nicholson, ""What do you see in me?"" And Jack Nicholson just says, ""You make me want to be a better man."" And you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen. Right? But at the moment, it's a Cicero thing. We like what Barack Obama says, but we don't do anything about it. So he comes over to this country, and he says, ""We need a big fiscal stimulus."" And everyone goes, ""Great!"" He leaves the country and the French and the Germans go, ""No, no, forget about that, absolutely not."" Nothing happens. He goes to Strasburg. He says, ""We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan."" And everyone goes, ""Great idea."" He leaves, people go, ""No no no, we're not going to do that. 5,000 maximum, and no rockets. No, no, not going to do it."" He goes to Prague, he says, ""We believe in a nuclear-free world."" And it's great to have an American president who can say the word ""nuclear,"" let's just point that out first. Do you remember that? George Bush, ""A nu-ca-ler."" Sorry, what? ""A nu-ca-ler."" (Laughter) Could you say ""avuncular""? ""Avunclear."" (Laughter) Thank you very much. But he says, ""We want a nuclear-free world."" And that day, North Korea, that very day, North Korea is just seeing if it can just get one over Japan — (Laughter) — and land it before ... So, where do we look for inspiration? We've still got Bill Clinton. ""Travels the world."" (Laughs) ""I believe, I believe it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who said ..."" (Laughter) ""Tell a lie; it was Diana Ross ..."" (Laughter) ""... who said, reach out and touch ..."" (Laughter) ""... somebody's gla — hand."" (Laughter) ""Make this world a better place, if you can. I just think that's important. I really do. And I was hoping Hillary would get to the White House, because she'd have been out of our home for four years. And I, you know."" (Laughter) ""So, when that didn't work out I had to make a few arrangements, let me tell you."" (Laughter) So, there's him. In Britain we have Prince Charles: ""And the environment is so important, all we can do. My wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to push emissions up her agenda."" (Laughter) Or, any South Africans, we have Mandela to inspire. Mandela, the great man Mandela. He's been honored with a statue now. The previous highest honor he had in Britain was a visit from the team from Ground Force, a gardening program. ""So, Nelson, how would you like a nice water feature?"" ""Ahh, listen to me Mr. Titchmarsh."" (Laughter) ""I was held in prison for nearly 30 years on an island in the middle of the ocean. Why would I need a bloody water feature?"" (Laughter) Very quickly: I wasn't quite sure how to end this talk and then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote from the ""Japanese Essays on Idleness"" which said it's nice to have something which is unfinished because it implies there is still room for growth. Thank you very much indeed. (Applause)"	"克里斯人很好。(即TED主辦人克里斯．安德森)我不曉得各位怎麼受得了克里斯，我真的不曉得。人超好，一整個禮拜。你都大可以跟他說：“克里斯，我真的很抱歉，我把你的車撞爛了。更慘的是，那輛車撞上了你的房子。你的房子也燒了。還有，你老婆跟著你最要好的朋友跑了。“ 而你曉得克里斯的回答會是，“謝謝。“（笑聲）“謝謝你跟我分享這些訊息，那真是有意思極了。“（笑聲）“感謝你帶領我來到一個我所不知道的境界。謝謝你。“（笑聲） 有一位—（掌聲）謝謝各位邀請我們來。在TED演講週比較後段才上場會面臨一個狀況，就是隨著時間逐漸的推移，所有其他講者已經把你原來想講的都講得差不多了。（笑聲）核融合，本來這個主題我可以講上十分鐘。光譜學，又是一個我原來想講的題材。平行宇宙論。所以今天早上我心想，“噢，好吧！我就表演個紙牌魔術算了。“（笑聲）結果那也被搶走了。今天是以馬內利日，我想大家都同意吧？不是嗎？以馬內利？絕對是啦。（掌聲）我打算跳一段舞來結束我的演講......（笑聲）那看起來一定會很寒愴。 所以我想我要—為了向以馬內利致意—我今天要做的是史上第一場TED全球拍賣。如果我可以現在開始的話，這是一臺謎語解碼機。（笑聲）有哪一位願意以1,000美元開始下標的？有嗎？ 謝謝你。看看布魯諾剛剛的表情。他的表情在說：“不，別這麼做。不要，拜託。別這麼做。千萬不要。“（笑聲） 我很煩惱。我剛接到邀請的時候，他們提到一件事，他們說：“用你在舞台上的15分鐘去改變世界。“ 15分鐘去改變世界。我不知道各位是怎樣啦，不過我換個插頭都要15分鐘了。（笑聲）所以說，想改變世界的這個想法可是非比尋常的。當然啦，現在我們知道我們用不著去換插頭了，剛剛我們才看過那個精彩的無線電力示範—非常神奇。各位都知道，那對我們都深具啟發性。在300年前，他可會因為這樣做而被綁在柱子上給活活燒死。（笑聲）不過現在那叫做“一種發想“。（笑聲）那很了不起。非常的神奇。不過各位都會遇到一些很神奇的人物，一些用全然不同的觀點在看待這個世界的人物。 好比昨天，大衛．多伊奇，另一個把我想講的話都講完了的人。（笑聲）不過當各位用那樣的角度來看世界的時候，真的會讓到星巴克消費變成一種全新的體驗，你們不覺得嗎？我的意思是，他走進星巴克，然後店員會問他：“您想來杯瑪奇亞朵，拿鐵，美式，還是卡布奇諾呢？“而他會說：""你們提供的東西還真是無限變量。""（笑聲）“這樣的話你們的咖啡哪還算是真的咖啡呢？“（笑聲）然後店員會說：“您不介意我幫下一位客人服務吧？“（笑聲） 昨天還有伊蓮‧摩根，她是不是棒極了？非常出色。精彩絕倫。她關於水猿的演講，當然，還有那個連結，跟達爾文進化論之間的連結以及我們全都光著屁股的事實，我們都全身多毛而且善泳。而她說，各位知道，她已經90歲了。她自己說她已經來日無多。但她還在拼命尋找更多證明那個連結的證據。而我想的卻是：“我就坐在路易斯．皮武旁邊。“（笑聲）這個男人游過了北極的冰冷海域，妳還需要找啥更多的證據啊？（笑聲）他人就在這裡。（掌聲）TED就是這樣把我們串聯起來的。 星期二我人不在這。所以我沒有真的看到戈登‧布朗的求職申請—呃，抱歉。(笑聲)我很抱歉。(掌聲)我很抱歉。真的，是真的。(掌聲)是真的，真的，呃...(掌聲)(模仿布朗):""全球問題需要仰賴蘇格蘭式的解決方案。""(笑聲)我覺得有意見的地方，是因為布朗走上舞台就像個剛摘下熊裝頭套的男人似的期待著這個世界。 (模仿布朗):""哈囉，我可以告訴各位後面的森林裡發生了甚麼事情嗎?""呃，不是。""(笑聲)""很抱歉，我只有18分鐘，18分鐘的時間來談談該如何拯救世界，拯救地球，全球性機構。我們在氣候變遷問題上所做的努力，我只有18分鐘，可惜我無法告訴各位在大不列顛帝國我們為了推動氣候變遷的議程做了多少努力，就像我們準備在希斯洛機場蓋的第三條跑道一樣...""(笑聲)""我們正在英國北部興建的大型燃煤發電廠，當然還有最讓人振奮的消息，就在今天，就在這個禮拜，不列顛唯一的風力渦輪機製造廠被強行關閉了。很遺憾，沒有足夠的時間，來跟大家提到這些事情。""(掌聲)""英國人為蘇格蘭人所做的事情...不是。""(笑聲)""基督教信條，基督教價值觀。汝等不可殺人，不可偷盜，不可貪戀鄰人的妻子。""(笑聲)""不過老實說，在我十一歲的時候，從來不覺得那會是啥問題。""(笑聲) (模仿東尼布萊爾)""嗯，好吧，好吧，呃。好吧，戈登，嗯。我可以，我可以談談雪莉，她是位很棒的女士，我的太太，有著美麗的笑容。那讓我想到，我得記得把那封信寄出去。""(笑聲)""我正在想，各位是知道的，人們有多健忘，戈登和我，我們向來相處得很愉快。好吧，當然也沒有像'斷背山'那樣啦。""(笑聲)""各位曉得，就在我離開辦公室前，我寫了封信給他。說，'下個月我能獲得你的支持嗎?'然後他回了信。他說:'不，你不能。'那讓我感到相當驚訝，因為我從來沒看過'不能'是這樣寫的。""(笑聲) 另外一件戈登可以在他演講裡提到的事情是他在2002年對著倫敦市長官邸—是對著那幢建築物沒錯；因為沒有人在聽。好吧，是對著人們，當談到金融業議題的時候，他說:""倫敦市為金融業所做的貢獻，我們，身為政府也想為總體經濟做出同樣的貢獻。""(笑聲)當各位想想金融業面臨了甚麼狀況，再看到當前經濟所面臨的狀況，你就會覺得:""唔，這個人還真是言而有信吶。""(笑聲) 但我們是處身於一個新世界裡。我們正處在一個全新的世界。就我記憶所及這是頭一次，如果你從銀行經理那兒寄來的一封信，卻搞不清楚究竟是你要跟他借錢，還是他想要跟你借錢。我沒說錯吧? 這些非同小可的事件，冰島網路帳戶。有哪位開過冰島網路帳戶的?你為啥要這樣做?為啥要—那跟去回覆從奈及利亞寄來的電子郵件沒啥兩樣，不是嗎?(笑聲)詢問你的帳戶明細。而，各位曉得，冰島，從來沒有想去削減它。他們沒有所謂的擔保抵押品。那他們有啥?他們有魚，就這樣。這就是為什麼首相在電視上說:""這件事為我們大家留下了很大的'黑線鱈'""(取haddock與headache的諧音)(笑聲) 我所做的很多事—我得在插科打諢之前先把它們給釐清楚。把金融危機釐清可是非常非常困難的一件事。幸好，像喬治．布希這樣的人物存在實在非常有幫助。他在一場晚宴上，為整件事情做了一個總結。他在晚宴上發言，說道:""華爾街喝醉了。""(笑聲)""現在它正在宿醉。""而那真是，各位曉得，那真是—(掌聲)那真是讓我們可以對金融危機感同身受的一種說法。那是喬治．布希完全可以感同身受的狀況。(笑聲) 而另一位，當然，是唐納．倫斯斐，他說:""世界上有已知的已知，那是我們知道我們所知道的事情。還有已知的未知，代表那些我們知道我們所不知道的事情。然後還有未知的未知，就是那些我們不知道我們所不知道的事情。""身為一個英國人，頭一次聽到這說法的時候我心想:""這是啥鬼話啊!""不過，各位知道，嗯，事實上，這說法還相當精闢。 班．柏克南說過:世界金融體系的混亂失序，是出自於—他們不知道，他們不知道自己在做甚麼。美國抵押貸款銀行協會主席在2006年說過，我引述他的話，""我們可以清楚的知道，並沒有甚麼驚天動地的事情會在美國掀起軒然大波。""這可是個對自己的工作十分駕輕就熟的男人。(笑聲)接著當危機發生時，羅曼兄弟的大股東說啦:""這種預估每10,000才會發生一次的事件正在每天發生，而且已經持續三天了。"" 所以說，這是非同小可的。這是個很難加以釐清界定的新世界。不過我們有個新希望。我們有個新人物。美國現在選出了第一位黑得很正大光明的總統。(笑聲)真是個好消息。而且不僅如此，還是個左撇子。各位有注意到嗎?在座有多少位是左撇子的?各位知道，在我所仰慕崇敬的很多人裡頭，不論是偉大的藝術家、設計師、思想家們，都是左撇子。昨天晚上有人跟我說，你知道嗎，身為左撇子，你得學會寫字的時候不把墨水搞得到處都是。而禮拜一的時候還有人在講台上談隱喻。我在想，這不正是個高明的隱喻嗎?一位寫字的時候不會把墨水搞得到處都是的美國總統勒。 各位喜歡這個隱喻嗎?相反的你會看到喬治．布希，嗯，這裡要用甚麼隱喻呢?我想應該是諸如水猿之類的東西，不是嗎?""好吧，我感到很抱歉。我是右撇子，不過我還是會把墨水搞得到處都是。""(笑聲)不過，各位知道，他離開了。他已經卸任了。那是美國歷史上的八年，我表演生涯的八分鐘，就這樣過去了。 ""那是一個時代的結束。而我剛好相信那是個偉大的時代。很多人跟我說他們覺得那是美國歷史上最天大的錯誤之一。。(era與error諧音)但我們在伊拉克推翻了他們的說法。他們說伊拉克和蓋達組織之間沒有任何連結。現在不就有啦。""(笑聲)""但我有句話要跟那些自殺炸彈客，也就是那些把他們自己給炸翻天的人說。""(笑聲)""我們一定會逮到你的。""(笑聲)""我們保證你不會再有下一次的!""(笑聲) 但是他卸任了，真慶幸能看到這位—美國有史以來最爛的演講者之一，讓位給美國有史以來最佳的演講者之一的歐巴馬。他勝選的當晚，你可能也在現場。他在芝加哥對著群眾演說，他說:""如果還有任何人還在懷疑在美國甚麼事情都可能發生...""我不能整段都模仿，因為時間會拖太長，真的會。(笑聲)不過你們大概知道那意思。接著是就職典禮。歐巴馬和聯邦最高法院首席大法官，他們互相把對方絆倒，他們吃螺絲然後把事情給搞砸了。而喬治．布希就坐在那邊:""呵呵呵呵呵...""(笑聲)""也不是那麼容易的吧?呵呵呵...""(笑聲) 有趣的是，戈登．布朗曾經談到西塞羅，西塞羅說過，人們會願意傾聽他們稱之為""偉大的演講""。他們願意傾聽狄摩西尼，然後他們會說:""我們來遊行吧!""而我們也都願意相信歐巴馬總統。就像電影""愛在心裡口難開""裡的台詞各位還記得那部海倫．杭特和傑克．尼柯遜主演的電影，在裡頭海倫．杭特問傑克．尼柯遜:""你是看上了我哪一點?""傑克．尼柯遜的回答則是:""你讓我想要成為一個更好的人。"" 而你們想要的是一個能啟發你、挑戰你並且讓你們想要變成一個更好的公民的總統。是嗎?但在那個當下，那只是類似西塞羅的效應。我們喜歡巴拉克．歐巴馬所說的事情，然而我們卻沒有為此採取任何行動。所以他來到這個國家，他說:""我們需要一個強大的財政刺激措施。""每個人都說:""太棒了!""然後他離開這個國家接著法國和德國說:""不行，不行，這件事就算了吧，絕對不行。""於是甚麼事情也沒發生。然後他到史特拉斯堡。他說:""我們需要給予阿富汗更有利的援助。""每個人都說:""真是好主意!""他離開後，人們跟著說:""不不不，我們不應該這樣做。5,000已經是上限了，而且不包刮火箭，不不，不能這樣做。""他去了布拉格，他說:""相信我們可以建立一個沒有核子武器的世界。"" 有個能把""核子""這個字唸清楚的美國總統真是太好了，我們先把這點提出來。各位記得嗎?喬治．布希:""盒子""對不起，你是說?""盒子""(笑聲)你能不能說""叔叔""?""俗俗""(笑聲)非常感謝你。 但歐巴馬說:""我們要的是一個沒有核子武器的世界。""而那天，北韓，就在同一天，北韓正在設法看是不是能比日本—(笑聲)—更早降落... 那麼，我們還能從何處尋求啟發?我們總還有比爾．柯林頓。""環遊世界。""(笑聲)""我相信，我相信艾森豪總統說過...""(笑聲)""騙人的，其實是黛安娜．蘿絲說的...""(笑聲)""...她說過，伸出手去探觸...""(笑聲)""...某人的—手。""(笑聲)""讓這個世界變得更美好，如果以可以的話。我認為那非常重要。我真的這麼認為。而且我也希望希拉蕊能夠入主白宮，因為這麼一來她就得搬離我們的家四年了。而我，你知道的。""(笑聲)""所以，當那件事情沒成功的時候，我就得再另做一些安排，我跟各位說。""(笑聲) 然後，就是他。在英國我們有查爾斯王子。""環境是相當重要的，我們都能為環境盡心。我太太對我不斷試著利用的她行程增加排放量感到非常厭煩。""(笑聲) 或者，在座的南非人，我們有曼德拉給我們啟發。曼德拉，偉大的曼德啦。現在都有他的雕像向他致意了。上次他在英國接受的最高榮譽是接受陸軍的邀請，參觀一個園藝活動。""那麼，尼爾森，你想不想要一個美麗的水造景?""""啊！聽我說帝奇馬緒先生。""(笑聲)""我之前被關了快三十年，就關在汪洋裡的一座小島上。我還幹嘛想要啥該死的水造景呢?""(笑聲) 很快的說一下:之前我其實不太確定要怎麼結尾直到昨天有人從""閒論日本散文""裡引述了一句很棒的話。大意是說未完成的事情是非常美好的因為那意味著還有繼續成長的空間。真的非常感謝各位。（掌聲）"
