jackson_browne_if_i_could_be_anywhere	(Applause) Thank you. (Music) ♫ Slide into the shimmering surface ♫ ♫ between two worlds. ♫ ♫ Standing at the center of time ♫ ♫ as it uncurls. ♫ ♫ Cutting through the veil of illusion. ♫ ♫ Moving beyond past conclusions. ♫ ♫ Wondering if all my doubt and confusion will clear. ♫ ♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫ ♫ if I could be anywhere, ♫ ♫ if I could be anywhere right now, ♫ ♫ I would want to be here. ♫ ♫ Searching for the future ♫ ♫ among the things we're throwing away. ♫ ♫ Trying to see the world ♫ ♫ through the junk we produce everyday. ♫ ♫ They say nothing lasts forever, ♫ ♫ but all the plastic ever made is still here. ♫ ♫ And no amount of closing our eyes ♫ ♫ will make it disappear. ♫ ♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫ ♫ if I could be anywhere, ♫ ♫ if I could be anywhere in history, ♫ ♫ I would want to be here. ♫ ♫ The Romans, the Spanish ♫ ♫ the British, the Dutch, ♫ ♫ American exceptionalism, so out of touch. ♫ ♫ The folly of empire repeating its course, ♫ ♫ imposing its will ♫ ♫ and ruling by force ♫ ♫ on and on through time. ♫ ♫ But the world can't take it very much longer. ♫ ♫ We're not going to make it ♫ ♫ unless we're smarter and stronger. ♫ ♫ The world is going to shake itself free of our greed ♫ ♫ somehow. ♫ ♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫ ♫ if I could be anywhere in time, ♫ ♫ if I could be anywhere and change things, ♫ ♫ it would have to be now. ♫ ♫ They say nothing last forever, ♫ ♫ but all the plastic ever made is still here. ♫ ♫ And no amount of closing our eyes ♫ ♫ will make it disappear. ♫ ♫ And the world can't take it ♫ ♫ very much longer. ♫ ♫ We're not going to make it ♫ ♫ unless we're smarter and stronger. ♫ ♫ The world's gonna shake itself free of our greed ♫ ♫ somehow. ♫ ♫ And the world can't take it, that you can see. ♫ ♫ If the oceans don't make it, neither will we. ♫ ♫ The world's gonna shake itself all the way free ♫ ♫ somehow. ♫ ♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫ ♫ if I could be anywhere in time, ♫ ♫ if I could be anywhere and change the outcome, ♫ ♫ it would have to be now. ♫ (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)	（掌聲） 謝謝。 （音樂） ♫滑進波光粼粼的水面♫♫在兩個世界之間♫♫站在時間的中心♫♫如舒展開一般♫♫穿過幻想的面紗♫♫跳出過去的結論♫♫想知道我所有的疑問和困惑能否解除♫♫如果我能去任何地方♫♫如果我能去任何地方♫♫如果我現在能去任何地方♫♫我想在這裡♫♫從我們丟棄的事物中♫♫尋找未來♫♫從我們產生的垃圾中♫♫試圖看清世界♫♫人們說世上沒有永遠♫♫但所有的塑膠仍舊在♫♫就算閉起我們的雙眼♫♫也不會消失♫♫如果我能去任何地方♫♫如果我能去任何地方♫♫如果我在過去能去任何地方♫♫我想在這裡♫♫羅馬人，西班牙人♫♫英國人，荷蘭人♫♫美國人是例外，完全脫節♫♫愚笨的帝國重蹈覆轍♫♫強加意念♫♫用力量統治♫♫不斷地重複著♫♫但世界再也承受不了♫♫我們不能讓它承受下去♫♫除非我們更聰明，更堅強♫♫世界在動搖，想從我們的貪婪中解放♫♫不知何故♫♫如果我能去任何地方♫♫如果我能及時去任何地方♫♫如果我能去任何地方改變些什麼♫♫必須是現在♫♫人們說世上沒有永遠♫♫但所有的塑膠依舊在♫♫就算閉起我們的雙眼♫♫也不會消失♫♫世界再也不能♫♫承受下去♫♫我們不能讓它繼續承受♫♫除非我們更聰明，更堅強♫♫世界正在動搖，想從我們的貪婪中解放♫♫不知何故♫♫你可以看到，世界無法承受♫♫如果海洋不能承受，我們也不能♫♫世界會動搖，去解放自己♫♫不知何故♫♫如果我能去任何地方♫♫如果我能馬上去任何地方♫♫如果我能去任何地方改變結果♫♫必須是現在♫ （掌聲） 謝謝。 （掌聲）
