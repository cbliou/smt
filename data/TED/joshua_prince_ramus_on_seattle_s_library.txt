joshua_prince_ramus_on_seattle_s_library	"I'm going to present three projects in rapid fire. I don't have much time to do it. And I want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid-fire presentation. The first is what I like to call a hyper-rational process. It's a process that takes rationality almost to an absurd level, and it transcends all the baggage that normally comes with what people would call, sort of a rational conclusion to something. And it concludes in something that you see here, that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality. The second — the second is that this process does not have a signature. There is no authorship. Architects are obsessed with authorship. This is something that has editing and it has teams, but in fact, we no longer see within this process, the traditional master architect creating a sketch that his minions carry out. And the third is that it challenges — and this is, in the length of this, very hard to support why, connect all these things — but it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility. High modernists said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic, almost anything can happen within them. I call it sort of ""shotgun flexibility"" — turn your head this way; shoot; and you're bound to kill something. So, this is the promise of high modernism: within a single space, actually, any kind of activity can happen. But as we're seeing, operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters. And so, with this sort of idea, what happens is, whatever actually is in the building on opening day, or whatever seems to be the most immediate need, starts to dwarf the possibility and sort of subsume it, of anything else could ever happen. And so we're proposing a different kind of flexibility, something that we call ""compartmentalized flexibility."" And the idea is that you, within that continuum, identify a series of points, and you design specifically to them. They can be pushed off-center a little bit, but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped. With high modernist flexibility, that doesn't really work. Now I'm going to talk about — I'm going to build up the Seattle Central Library in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams, and I truly mean this is the design process that you'll see. With the library staff and the library board, we settled on two core positions. This is the first one, and this is showing, over the last 900 years, the evolution of the book, and other technologies. This diagram was our sort of position piece about the book, and our position was, books are technology — that's something people forget — but it's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media. The second premise — and this was something that was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first — is that libraries, since the inception of Carnegie Library tradition in America, had a second responsibility, and that was for social roles. Ok, now, this I'll come back to later, but something — actually, the librarians at first said, ""No, this isn't our mandate. Our mandate is media, and particularly the book."" So what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building. The upper diagram is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility. Sort of, any activity could happen anywhere. We don't know the future of the library; we don't know the future of the book; and so, we'll use this approach. And what we saw were buildings that were very generic, and worse — not only were they very generic — so, not only does the reading room look like the copy room look like the magazine area — but it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in it. And in this case, what was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book. And so we proposed what's at the lower diagram. Very dumb approach: simply compartmentalize. Put those things whose evolution we could predict — and I don't mean that we could say what would actually happen in the future, but we have some certainty of the spectrum of what would happen in the future — put those in boxes designed specifically for it, and put the things that we can't predict on the rooftops. So that was the core idea. Now, we had to convince the library that social roles were equally important to media, in order to get them to accept this. What you're seeing here is actually their program on the left. That's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory. Our first operation was to re-digest it back to them, show it to them and say, ""You know what? We haven't touched it, but only one-third of your own program is dedicated to media and books. Two-thirds of it is already dedicated — that's the white band below, the thing you said isn't important — is already dedicated to social functions."" So once we had presented that back to them, they agreed that this sort of core concept could work. We got the right to go back to first principles — that's the third diagram. We recombined everything. And then we started making new decisions. What you're seeing on the right is the design of the library, specifically in terms of square footage. On the left of that diagram, here, you'll see a series of five platforms — sort of combs, collective programs. And on the right are the more indeterminate spaces; things like reading rooms, whose evolution in 20, 30, 40 years we can't predict. So that literally was the design of the building. They signed it, and to their chagrin, we came back a week later, and we presented them this. And as you can see, it is literally the diagram on the right. (Laughter) We just sized — no, really, I mean that, literally. The things on the left-hand side of the diagram, those are the boxes. We sized them into five compartments. They're super-efficient. We had a very low budget to work with. We pushed them around on the site to make very literal contextual relationships. The reading room should be able to see the water. The main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code, and so forth. So, you see the five platforms, those are the boxes. within each one, a very discrete thing is happening. The area in between is sort of an urban continuum, these things that we can't predict their evolution to the same degree. To give you some sense of the power of this idea, the biggest block is what we call the book spiral. It's literally built in a very inexpensive way — it is a parking garage for books. It just so happens to be on the 6th through 10th floors of the building, but that is not necessarily an expensive approach. And it allows us to organize the entire Dewey Decimal System on one continuous run; no matter how it grows or contracts within the building, it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears that we've all experienced in public libraries. (Laughter) And so this was the final operation, which was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter, and to hold onto them with a skin. That skin serves double duty, again, for economics. One, it is the lateral stability for the entire building; it's a structural element. But its dimensions were designed not only for structure, but also for holding on every piece of glass. The glass was then — I'll use the word impregnated — but it had a layer of metal that was called ""stretched metal."" That metal acts as a microlouver, so from the exterior of the building, the sun sees it as totally opaque, but from the interior, it's entirely transparent. So now I'm going to take you on a tour of the building. Let me see if I can find it. For anyone who gets motion sickness, I apologize. So, this is the building. And I think what's important is, when we first unveiled the building, the public saw it as being totally about our whim and ego. And it was defended, believe it or not, by the librarians. They said, ""Look, we don't know what it is, but we know it's everything that we need it to be, based on the observations that we've done about the program."" This is going into one of the entries. So, it's an unusual building for a public library, obviously. So now we're going into what we call the living room. This is actually a program that we invented with the library. It was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space. There are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain in downtown Seattle, but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain. So this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything, including eat, yell, play chess and so forth. Now we're moving up into what we call the mixing chamber. That was the main technology area in the building. You'll have to tell me if I'm going too fast for you. And now up. This is actually the place that we put into the building so I could propose to my wife, right there. (Laughter) She said yes. (Laughter) I'm running out of time, so I'm actually going to stop. I can show this to you later. But let's see if I can very quickly get into the book spiral, because I think it's, as I said, the most — this is the main reading room — the most unique part of the building. You dizzy yet? Ok, so here, this is the book spiral. So, it's very indiscernible, but it's actually a continuous stair-stepping. It allows you to, on one city block, go up one full floor, so that it's on a continuum. Ok, now I'm going to go back, and I'm going to hit a second project. I'm going to go very, very quickly through this. Now this is the Dallas Theater. It was an unusual client for us, because they came to us and they said, ""We need you to do a new building. We've been working in a temporary space for 30 years, but because of that temporary space, we've become an infamous theater company. Theater is really focused in New York, Chicago and Seattle, with the exception of the Dallas Theater Company."" And the very fact that they worked in a provisional space meant that for Beckett, they could blow out a wall; they could do ""Cherry Orchard"" and blow a hole through the floor, and so forth. So it was a very daunting task for us to do a brand-new building that could be a pristine building, but keep this kind of experimental nature. And the second is, they were what we call a multi-form theater, they do different kinds of performances in repertory. So they in the morning will do something in arena, then they'll do something in proscenium and so forth. And so they needed to be able to quickly transform between different theater organizations, and for operational budget reasons, this actually no longer happens in pretty much any multi-form theater in the United States, so we needed to figure out a way to overcome that. So our thought was to literally put the theater on its head: to take those things that were previously defined as front-of-house and back-of-house and stack them above house and below house, and to create what we called a theater machine. We invest the money in the operation of the building. It's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere, wherever you place it, the area under it is charged for theatrical performances. And it allowed us to go back to first principles, and redefine fly tower, acoustic enclosure, light enclosure and so forth. And at the push of a button, it allows the artistic director to move between proscenium, thrust, and in fact, arena and traverse and flat floor, in a very quick transfiguration. So in fact, using operational budget, we can — sorry, capital cost — we can actually achieve what was no longer achievable in operational cost. And that means that the artistic director now has a palette that he or she can choose from, between a series of forms and a series of processions, because that enclosure around the theater that is normally trapped with front-of-house and back-of-house spaces has been liberated. So an artistic director has the ability to have a performance that enters in a Wagnerian procession, shows the first act in thrust, the intermission in a Greek procession, second act in arena, and so forth. So I'm going to show you what this actually means. This is the theater up close. Any portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely. The light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure, so you can do Beckett with Dallas as the backdrop. Portions can be opened, so you can now actually have motorcycles drive directly into the performance, or you can even just have an open-air performance, or for intermissions. The balconies all move to go between those configurations, but they also disappear. The proscenium line can also disappear. You can bring enormous objects in, so in fact, the Dallas Theater Company — their first show will be a play about Charles Lindbergh, and they'll want to bring in a real aircraft. And then it also provides them, in the off-season, the ability to actually rent out their space for entirely different things. This is it from a distance. Open up entire portions for different kinds of events. And at night. Again, remove the light enclosure; keep the acoustic enclosure. This is a monster truck show. I'm going to show now the last project. This also is an unusual client. They inverted the whole idea of development. They came to us and they said — unlike normal developers — they said, ""We want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in Louisville. That's our main goal."" And so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money, they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown. And the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma, so they worked in reverse. And that pro forma led us to a mixed-use building that was very large, in order to support their aspirations of the art, but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate, interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within. And it also charged us with thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of sub-building. So this is Louisville's skyline, and I'm going to take you through the various constraints that led to the project. First: the physical constraints. We actually had to operate on three discrete sites, all of them well smaller than the size of the building. We had to operate next to the new Muhammad Ali Center, and respect it. We had to operate within the 100-year floodplain. Now, this area floods three to four times a year, and there's a levee behind our site, similar to the ones that broke in New Orleans. Had to operate behind the I-64 corridor, a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites. So we're starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub. Underneath the bathtub are the city's main power lines. And there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add, that would link a series of cultural buildings, and a view corridor — because this is the historic district — that they didn't want to obstruct with a new building. (Laughter) And now we're going to add 1.1 million square feet. And if we did the traditional thing, that 1.1 million square feet — these are the different programs — the traditional thing would be to identify the public elements, place them on sites, and now we'd have a really terrible situation: a public thing in the middle of a bathtub that floods. And then we would size all the other elements — the different commercial elements: hotel, luxury housing, offices and so forth — and dump it on top. And we would create something that was unviable. In fact — and you know this — this is called the Time Warner Building. (Laughter) So our strategy was very simple. Just lift the entire block, flip some of the elements over, reposition them so they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown, and make circulation connections and reroute the road. So that's the basic concept, and now I'm going to show you what it leads to. Ok, it seems a very formal, willful gesture, but something derived entirely out of the constraints. And again, when we unveiled it, there was a sort of nervousness that this was about an architect making a statement, not an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems. Now, within that center zone, as I said, we have the ability to mix a series of things. So here, this is sort of an x-ray — the towers are totally developer-driven. They told us the dimensions, the sizes and so forth, and we focused on taking all the public components — the lobbies, the bars — everything that different commercial elements would have, and combined it in the center, in the sort of subway map, in the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum. So it creates a situation like this, where you have artists who can operate within an art space that also has an amazing view on the 22nd floor, but it also has proximity that the curator can either open or close. It allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen, or to see the art, and so forth. It also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool, they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool, so they're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary gallery space. So, how to build this. It's very simple: it's a chair. So, we begin by building the cores. As we're building the cores, we build the contemporary art museum at grade. That allows us to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency. This is not a high-budget building. The moment the cores get to mid level, we finish the art museum; we put all the mechanical equipment in it; and then we jack it up into the air. This is how they build really large aircraft hangars, for instance, the ones that they did for the A380. Finish the cores, finish the meat and you get something that looks like this. Now I only have about 30 seconds, so I want to start an animation, and we'll conclude with that. Thank you. (Applause) Chris asked me to add — the theater is under construction, and this project will start construction in about a year, and finish in 2010.

""這個是其中一個入口.所以對於一個公共圖書館來說這是一座不尋常的建築.很顯然. 接著我們進入到閱覽室 — 抱歉, 這是大廳.這是我們和這個圖書館一起開發的程序眾所周知, 公共圖書館是最後一點免費的公共場所.有足夠的商場下雨的時候你可以去在西雅圖市中心,但是沒有很多免費的場所讓你躲雨.這是一個沒有確定目的自由場地, 人們基本上可以做任何事,包括吃東西, 叫喊, 下棋, 等等. 接著我們移到我們稱作混合區.這是這個建築的主要場地.讓我知道如果我的速度太快了.再往上.這個地方我們放進這個建築好讓我向我妻子求婚. 就是這.(笑聲)她同意了. 我的時間不夠了, 就此打住.以後再給你看.但我們看看能否快速地進入圖書螺旋,因為我認為, 如我提到, 最 —這是主閱覽室 — 建築中最獨特的部分.有沒有頭暈?這二很難看清,但它實際上是一個連續的樓梯.它讓你, 在一個街區的距離,上一層樓, 所以這是一個連續上升的階梯. 好, 現在我要回來, 介紹第二個項目.我將很快的介紹這個.這個是達拉斯劇院. 這是一個因為他們找上我們, 說,我們需要你建一個新的建築. 我們已經在一個臨時的地方工作了30年.但由於是一個臨時的場所,我們變成了一個籍籍無名的劇院.劇院真正是集中在紐約, 芝加哥和西雅圖,一個例外就是達拉斯劇院.""他們在臨時場所工作, 實際上意味著, 他們可以為了貝克特炸毀一座牆;他們可以演""櫻桃園"", 並且在地板上炸一個洞, 等等. 對我們來說建一座新樓是一件很嚇人的任務要保持完整無缺的建築,又要保持這種實驗性的特色.另外, 他們是我們所稱的多形式劇院: 他們有不同形式的表演.早上會在舞台上演,然後又在台前, 諸如此類.所以他們需要能夠很快的在不同劇院結構之間變化,因為經營成本的原因,這從不發生在美國其他任何多形式劇院,所以我們要想一個辦法克服這個. 我們的想法是合理安排劇院把原先定為前面和後面的東西拿出來放成上下結構 - 樓上和樓下創造出一個我們稱為劇院機器的東西.我們把錢花在了建築的運作上.就好像這個建築可以放在任何地方: 不管你放在哪, 下面的面積用作劇院表演.這使得我們能過回到最基本的原則,重新定義舞台牆,聲光效果,等等.按一個按鈕, 藝術總監就可以在台前,舞台, 台中, 地板之間很快的移動. 實際上, 我們, 用了運作成本 —不對, 資本成本 — 我們能獲得運作成本不能獲得的效果.這意味著現在藝術指導有一個調色板, 她或者他能夠從一系列的形式和隊伍之間選擇,因為劇院中通常的夾在台前和台後的空間被解放出來了.所以藝術指導就能夠展示 —先來一出瓦格納的遊行推出第一幕,再過度到希臘式的場景,第二幕到競技場, 諸如此類. 我要向你展示一下 — 這個實際上是什麼意思.這個是戲院的近觀.這個戲院的任何一部份都能被分別打開.燈光道具和聲響道具能分別吊起來所以你能演貝克特,而背景是達拉斯.每一部分都能打開, 所以現在可以有摩托車直接開進表演中, 或者你甚至可以來一個露天表演,或終場休息.陽台都移到這些設置中間,但都被隱藏起來.前台也可以隱藏起來,你能引進巨大的物件, 所以實際上他們的 —達拉斯劇院 — 他們的第一場表演將是關於查尔斯林白的一場秀,表演中會用到真正的飛機.同時,這種設計使得他們, 在淡季時,能夠把場地出租給不同的活動.這是在晚上看起來的樣子 — 抱歉, 有點距離.把所有部份都打開來適應不同的活動.在晚上.把燈光道具移開; 聲響不動.這是一個大型卡車展. 接著我要介紹最後一個項目.這也是一個不同尋常的顧客.他們倒置了整個開發的思想.他們找到我們,說 — 不像普通開發者 —他們說, ""我們想建一個現代藝術展覽館在路易斯威爾. 這是我們主要的目標.""不是為了有個賺錢的機會,他們想要能夠促進市中心的活動.實際上他們想要這個現代藝術館建成他們的一種樣本所以他們反其道而行.這個樣板引導我們到一個非常巨大的多功能建築它的目標是支持他們對藝術的熱愛,但同時也增加技術與其他商業空間的合作與交互從而吸引更多的藝術家來這裡工作.這還要求我們考慮如何設計一個建築, 即是一個單獨的建築同時也好像是一組建築中的一座. 接著我要 — 這是路易斯维尔地平线 —我要給你們一一介紹完成這個項目的種種限制因素.首先, 物理上的限制. 我們必須在三個不同的地點操作,每個地點, 都比這個建築要小很多.我們必須在新的穆罕穆得阿里中心邊上施工並且不能影響它.我們必須在這個百年洪泛區施工.現在, 這個地區每年發洪水三到四次,在我們的工地後面有一個泄洪堤和新奧爾良那個壞了的很類似.我們必須在I-64走廊後施工,這是一條從這些不同的地點中穿過的街道.綜合所有這些因素, — 我們就好像在浴盆中修建一個噩夢的組合體.在浴缸下面,是城市的主要供電系統.他們還想加一個行人過道來把一系列的文化建築連繫起來,還有加一個觀光通道 — 因為這是一個歷史性的城區 —他們也不像阻礙新的建築.(笑聲) 現在我們要加上1.1百萬平方英尺.如果照傳統做法, 那1.1 百萬平方英尺 —這些是不同的項目 — 傳統做法就是確認公共元素, 把他們融入施工.現在我們處在一個很糟糕的處境:一個公共的建築在一個漲水的盆地中間.接著我們來看看所有其他的因素 —不同的商業因素:賓館, 豪華住宅, 辦公場地, 等等 —-全都要放進來. 我們將創造一個根本不可能行的通的東西.實際上 — 你知道的 — 這就是被稱作時代華納大樓的東西.(笑聲) 我們的方法很簡單.就是把整個街區升起來,重組一些元素好讓它們有適當的風景,同時也和市中心有適當的聯繫,然後再連接道路.這就是基本概念.現在我來展示一下這個概念生成了什麼樣的作品. 它看上去是非常正式, 任性而為,但卻是完全符合所有的限制因素.在我們揭幕時, 大家有點緊張因為這是建築師發表一個聲明,而不是企圖解決一系列問題.現在, 在那個中心區, 如我所說的,我們能把一系列東西混合起來.所以這裡你能看到的是這些 —有點像x射線 — 這些高樓完全是按開發商的意願建的. 他們告訴我們尺寸大小等等我們就將注意力集中在所有的公共部分 —大廳, 酒吧,所有不同的商業元素共同具有的東西 —把它們結合在中央, 有點像地鐵地圖,在過渡區包括進這個現代藝術展覽館. 這就形成了這個佈局,可以讓藝術家們從他們的工作室看到22層樓的景觀,同時展覽館館長也能方便地開放或關閉展覽館.人們看得見騎自行車鍛鍊的人們,而騎車的人也可以瀏覽藝術作品, 等等.這也意味著, 如果藝術家想要選擇游泳池,他們能在游泳池開個畫展,而不需要總是局限於展覽館的空間. 那麼這個怎麼建呢.非常簡單: 這是一個椅子.先建核心部分.在修建核心部分的同時, 我們在同一層面上修建現代展覽館.這使得我們在施工和成本上都有難以置信的高效率.這不是一個花費很高的建築.在核心部分建成一半時,我們完成了藝術館, 然後我們放入所有的機械設備接著把它升起來.這種方法常用來生產大型的航天飛機庫,比如說, 他們為A380修的那些.完成了核心部分, 完成了重要的部分你看到的就是這個. 我只有30秒時間, 所以我想開始一個動畫, 以此作為結論.(鼓掌) 克里斯讓我額外說明 —這個劇院正在建設之中,這個項目將在一年之後開始修建,將在2010年預期完成."
