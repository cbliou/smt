Well, I have to tell you, from  the bottom of our hearts, thank you so very, very much. Do you know to date the ALS Association has raised 125 million dollars? Woo hoo! (Applause) It takes me back to the summer of 2011. My family, my kids had all grown up. We were officially empty nesters, and we decided, let's  go on a family vacation. Jenn, my daughter, and my son-in-law came down from New York. My youngest, Andrew, he came down from his home in Charlestown where he was working in Boston, and my son Pete, who had played at  Boston College, baseball, had played baseball  professionally in Europe, and had now come home and was selling group insurance, he also joined us. And one night, I found myself having a beer with Pete, and Pete was looking at  me and he just said, ""You know, Mom, I don't know, selling group insurance  is just not my passion."" He said, ""I just don't feel  I'm living up to my potential. I don't feel this is my mission in life."" And he said, ""You know,  oh by the way, Mom, I have to leave early from vacation because my inter-city league team  that I play for made the playoffs, and I have to get back to Boston  because I can't let my team down. I'm just not as passionate about my job as I am about baseball."" So off Pete went, and  left the family vacation — break a mother's heart — and he went, and we  followed four days later to see the next playoff game. We're at the playoff game,  Pete's at the plate, and a fastball's coming in, and it hits him on the wrist. Oh, Pete. His wrist went completely limp, like this. So for the next six months, Pete went back to his home in Southie, kept working that unpassionate job, and was going to doctors to see what was wrong with this wrist that never came back. Six months later, in March, he called my husband  and me, and he said, ""Oh, Mom and Dad, we have a doctor that found a diagnosis for that wrist. Do you want to come with the doctor's appointment with me?"" I said, ""Sure, we'll come in."" That morning, Pete, John and I all got up, got dressed, got in our cars — three separate cars because we were going to go to work after the doctor's appointment to find out what happened to the wrist. We walked into the  neurologist's office, sat down, four doctors walk in, and the head neurologist sits down. And he says, ""Well, Pete, we've been looking at all the tests, and I have to tell you,  it's not a sprained wrist, it's not a broken wrist, it's not nerve damage in the wrist, it's not an infection, it's not Lyme disease."" And there was this deliberate  elimination going up, and I was thinking to myself, where is he going with this? Then he put his hands on his knees, he looked right at my  27-year-old kid, and said, ""I don't know how to  tell a 27-year-old this: Pete, you have ALS."" ALS? I had had a friend whose  80-year-old father had ALS. I looked at my husband, he looked at me, and then we looked at the  doctor, and we said, ""ALS? Okay, what treatment? Let's go. What do we do? Let's go."" And he looked at us, and he said, ""Mr. and Mrs. Frates, I'm sorry to tell you this, but there's no treatment  and there's no cure."" We were the worst culprits. We didn't even understand that it had been 75 years since Lou Gehrig and nothing had been done  in the progress against ALS. So we all went home, and Jenn and Dan flew home from Wall Street, Andrew came home from Charlestown, and Pete went to B.C. to pick up his then-girlfriend Julie  and brought her home, and six hours later after diagnosis, we're sitting around  having a family dinner, and we're having small chat. I don't even remember  cooking dinner that night. But then our leader, Pete, set the vision, and talked to us just like  we were his new team. He said, ""There will be  no wallowing, people."" He goes, ""We're not looking back, we're looking forward. What an amazing opportunity  we have to change the world. I'm going to change the face of this unacceptable situation of ALS. We're going to move the needle, and I'm going to get it in front of philanthropists like Bill Gates."" And that was it. We  were given our directive. So in the days and months that followed, within a week, we had  our brothers and sisters and our family come to us, that they were already  creating Team Frate Train. Uncle Dave, he was the webmaster; Uncle Artie, he was the accountant; Auntie Dana, she was the graphic artist; and my youngest son, Andrew, quit his job, left his  apartment in Charlestown and says, ""I'm going to take care  of Pete and be his caregiver."" Then all those people,  classmates, teammates, coworkers that Pete had inspired throughout his whole life, the circles of Pete all started intersecting with one another, and made Team Frate Train. Six months after diagnosis, Pete was given an award at a  research summit for advocacy. He got up and gave a very eloquent speech, and at the end of the  speech, there was a panel, and on the panel were these pharmaceutical executives and biochemists and clinicians and I'm sitting there and  I'm listening to them and most of the content  went straight over my head. I avoided every science  class I ever could. But I was watching these people, and I was listening to them, and they were saying,  ""I, I do this, I do that,"" and there was a real  unfamiliarity between them. So at the end of their talk, the panel, they had questions and answers, and boom, my hand went right up, and I get the microphone, and I look at them and I say, ""Thank you. Thank you so much for working in ALS. It means so very much to us."" I said, ""But I do have to tell you that I'm watching your body language and I'm listening to what you're saying. It just doesn't seem like there's a whole  lot of collaboration going on here. And not only that, where's the flip chart with the action items and the  follow-up and the accountability? What are you going to do  after you leave this room?"" And then I turned around and there was about 200 pairs  of eyes just staring at me. And it was that point that I realized that I had talked about  the elephant in the room. Thus my mission had begun. So over the next couple of years, Pete — we've had our highs and our lows. Pete was put on a compassionate use drug. It was hope in a bottle for  the whole ALS community. It was in a phase III trial. Then six months later, the  data comes back: no efficacy. We were supposed to  have therapies overseas, and the rug was  pulled out from under us. So for the next two years, we just watched my son  be taken away from me, little by little every day. Two and a half years ago, Pete was hitting home  runs at baseball fields. Today, Pete's completely paralyzed. He can't hold his head up any longer. He's confined to a motorized wheelchair. He can no longer swallow or eat. He has a feeding tube. He can't speak. He talks with eye gaze technology and a speech generating device, and we're watching his lungs, because his diaphragm  eventually is going to give out and then the decision will be made to put him on a ventilator or not. ALS robs the human of all their physical  parts, but the brain stays intact. So July 4th, 2014, 75th year of Lou Gehrig's  inspirational speech comes, and Pete is asked by MLB.com to write an article in the Bleacher Report. And it was very significant, because he  wrote it using his eye gaze technology. Twenty days later,  the ice started to fall. On July 27th, Pete's  roommate in New York City, wearing a Quinn For The Win shirt, signifying Pat Quinn, another  ALS patient known in New York, and B.C. shorts said, ""I'm taking the ALS  Ice Bucket Challenge,"" picked up the ice, put it over his head. ""And I'm nominating ...""  And he sent it up to Boston. And that was on July 27th. Over the next couple  of days, our news feed was full of family and friends. If you haven't gone back, the nice thing about Facebook is that you have the dates, you can go back. You've got to see Uncle Artie's  human Bloody Mary. I'm telling you, it's one of the best ones, and that was probably in day two. By about day four, Uncle  Dave, the webmaster, he isn't on Facebook, and I get a text from him,  and it says, ""Nancy, what the hell is going on?"" Uncle Dave gets a hit  every time Pete's website is gone onto, and his  phone was blowing up. So we all sat down and we realized, money is coming in — how amazing. So we knew awareness  would lead to funding, we just didn't know it would only take a couple of days. So we got together, put our best  501(c)(3)s on Pete's website, and off we went. So week one, Boston media. Week two, national media. It was during week two  that our neighbor next door opened up our door and threw a pizza across the kitchen floor, saying, ""I think you people might  need food in there."" (Laughter) Week three, celebrities —  Entertainment Tonight, Access Hollywood. Week four, global — BBC, Irish Radio. Did anyone see ""Lost In Translation""? My husband did Japanese television. It was interesting. (Laughter) And those videos, the popular ones. Paul Bissonnette's  glacier video, incredible. How about the redemption nuns of Dublin? Who's seen that one? It's absolutely fantastic. J.T., Justin Timberlake. That's when we knew, that  was a real A-list celebrity. I go back on my texts, and I can see ""JT! JT!"" My sister texting me. Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany. Incredible. And the ALS patients, you know what their favorite ones are, and their families'? All of them. Because this misunderstood and  underfunded ""rare"" disease, they just sat and watched people  saying it over and over: ""ALS, ALS."" It was unbelievable. And those naysayers, let's just talk a couple  of stats, shall we? Okay, so the ALS Association, they think by year end, it'll be 160 million dollars. ALS TDI in Cambridge, they raised three million dollars. Well, guess what? They had a clinical trial for a drug that they've been developing. It was on a three-year track for funding. Two months. It's coming out starting in two months. (Applause) And YouTube has reported that over 150 countries have posted Ice Bucket Challenges for ALS. And Facebook, 2.5 million videos, and I had the awesome adventure visiting the Facebook campus last week, and I said to them, ""I know what it was like in my house. I can't imagine what it  was like around here."" All she said was, ""Jaw-dropping."" And my family's favorite video? Bill Gates. Because the night Pete was diagnosed, he told us that he was going to get ALS in front of philanthropists like Bill Gates, and he did it. Goal number one, check. Now on to the treatment and cure. (Applause) So okay, after all of this ice, we know that it was much more than just pouring buckets of  ice water over your head, and I really would like to leave you with a couple of things that  I'd like you to remember. The first thing is, every morning when you wake up, you can choose to live your day in positivity. Would any of you blame me if I just was in the fetal position and pulled the covers  over my head every day? No, I don't think anybody would blame me, but Pete has inspired us to wake up every morning and be  positive and proactive. I actually had to ditch support groups because everybody was in there saying that spraying their lawns with chemicals, that's why they got ALS, and I was like, ""I don't think so,"" but I had to get away from the negativity. The second thing I want to leave you with is the person at the  middle of the challenge has to be willing to have  the mental toughness to put themselves out there. Pete still goes to baseball games and he still sits with his  teammates in the dugout, and he hangs his gravity feed bag right on the cages. You'll see the kids, they're  up there hanging it up. ""Pete, is that okay?"" ""Yup."" And then they put it  right into his stomach. Because he wants them to see what the reality of this is, and how he's never, ever going to give up. And the third thing I  want to leave you with: If you ever come across a situation that you see as so unacceptable, I want you to dig down as deep as you can and find your best mother bear and go after it. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) I know that I'm running over, but I've got to leave you with this: the gifts that my son has given me. I have had 29 years of having the honor of being the mother of Pete Frates. Pete Frates has been inspiring  and leading his whole life. He's thrown out kindness, and all that kindness  has come back to him. He walks the face of the Earth  right now and knows why he's here. What a gift. The second thing that my son has given me is he's given me my mission in life. Now I know why I'm here. I'm going to save my son, and if it doesn't happen in time for him, I'm going to work so that no other mother has to go through what I'm going through. And the third thing,  and last but not least gift that my son has given me, as an exclamation point to the miraculous month of August 2014: That girlfriend that he went to get on  the night of diagnosis is now his wife, and Pete and Julie have given me my  granddaughter, Lucy Fitzgerald Frates. Lucy Fitzgerald Frates came two weeks early as the exclamation point on August 31st, 2014. And so — (Applause) — And so let me leave you with  Pete's words of inspiration that he would use to classmates, coworkers and teammates. Be passionate. Be genuine. Be hardworking. And don't forget to be great. Thank you. (Applause)"	各位，下午好。你們中有多少人參加了ALS（肌萎縮側索硬化症）漸凍人冰桶挑戰？（掌聲）哇噢！我要發自肺腑地告訴你們，非常非常感謝你們。你們知道嗎，到現在漸凍人協會已經募集到了一億兩千五百萬美元？哇噢 ！（掌聲） 那是在 2011 年夏，我們全家，孩子們全都長大成人了。我們夫婦成了標準的空巢老人，我們決定，全家來一次親子遊。珍，我女兒和女婿從紐約過來。我的小兒子安德魯從他查爾斯頓的家來了。他當時在波士頓工作，還有我的另外一個兒子皮特在波士頓學院時是棒球選手，後來在歐洲打職棒，現在回來了，當時他在賣團體保險，他也來了。有天晚上，我和皮特在喝啤酒聊天，皮特看著我，然後對我說：「老媽，我有點糾結，我對賣團體保險根本沒有任何激情。」他說道：「我感覺不到任何成就感，不覺得這是我的人生使命。」他接著說：「還有，老媽，我得提前結束假期，我所在的城際聯盟隊進了季後賽，我要回到波士頓，我不能讓隊友失望。我對工作的熱忱完全比不上棒球。」 就這樣，皮特提前走了，離開了全家人一起的旅行，讓老媽很是受傷，他走後四天，我們也結束假期回來了，去看下一次季後賽。我們在季後賽現場觀看，皮特在本壘，來了一個快球，擊中了他的手腕。天啊，皮特！他的手腕完全軟了，就像這樣。接下來的六個月，皮特回到了他在南波士頓的家，繼續他沒有熱忱的工作，看醫生，看看手腕到底是怎麼了，為什麼總也不好。 六個月後，三月份，他打電話給我先生和我，問道，「老媽老爸，現在有個能診斷我的手腕的醫生。你們願不願意陪我一起去見醫生？」我說：「當然，我們願意。」那天早上，皮特、約翰和我全都起來了，穿好衣服，上了車——三輛車，因為見過醫生，查清楚手腕到底怎麼了後，我們各自還要去上班。我們走進神經專家的辦公室，坐了下來，進來了四個醫生，首席醫生坐了下來。他說道：「皮特，我們看了所有的檢查結果，我要告訴你，這不是腕關節扭傷，也不是腕關節骨折，不是腕關節神經損傷，不是發炎，也不是萊姆病。」就這樣逐個逐個地排除，我就在想，接下來他要說什麼？然後他把自己的雙手放到膝蓋上，雙眼直直地看著我27 歲的兒子，然後說：「我不知道該怎麼告訴一個 27 歲年輕人，皮特，這是肌萎縮側索硬化症。」肌萎縮側索硬化症？（漸凍人症）我有個朋友的父親，80 歲了，就是這病。我和我先生對視了一下，我們一齊看著醫生，問道：「漸凍人症？好吧，怎麼治？我們去治。要做什麼？我們去做。」然後他看著我們，說道：「弗拉特斯夫婦，我非常遺憾地告訴你們，這種病沒法治，治不了。」我們簡直蠢到家了。我們甚至根本不知道自從知名棒球手盧·賈里格罹患這種病後，75 年來，在對抗漸凍人症方面，醫學界尚未有任何進展。 就這樣我們回家了，珍和丹從紐約華爾街飛了回來，安德魯從查爾斯頓回來了，皮特去了波士頓學院接他當時還是女朋友的朱莉，帶她回來，診斷結果出來 6 個小時後，我們全家人坐在晚餐餐桌前，簡單地聊了起來。我甚至都不記得那天我做了晚飯。然後，我們的領袖皮特，設定了目標，他說話時的語氣就像我們是他的新隊友。他說：「各位，不要沮喪。」他接著說：「我們不要往後看，我們要往前看。這是多麼絕佳的機會來改變世界 。我要改變漸凍人症這種目前讓人無法接受的現狀。我們要快速行動起來，我要讓比爾·蓋茨這樣的慈善家了解到這種疾病。」就這樣，我們得到了前進的方向。 在接下來的日子裡，一周之內，我們把兄弟姐妹親朋好友召集到了家裡來，他們已經著手打造「弗拉特斯應援團」(Team Frate Train) 專頁。大維叔叔是我們的網路管理員，亞提叔叔是會計，戴娜姑媽是平面設計，我的小兒子安德魯辭工，離開他在查爾斯頓的家。他說：「我來照顧皮特，做他的護士。」然後所有這些人，同學、隊友，皮特長期以來提攜共事的同事，皮特的人脈，開始彼此溝通聯絡，最後就有了臉書上的「弗拉特斯應援團」專頁。 診斷結果出來六個月後，皮特在一次研究高峰會上因倡導此病獲獎。他站了出來，發表了一場動人的演講，演講結束後是討論會，討論會成員是製藥企業的高管、生物化學家和臨床醫生。我就坐在那裡，聽他們在講，講的東西我全然不懂。我讀書時，科學方面的課程全沒好好聽講。但是，我就看著這些人，聽他們在講，他們表示「我做這個，我做那個，」他們彼此之間沒有任何默契。在討論會結束後，是問答環節，我的手就嗖地舉了起來，我走到麥克風前，看著他們，我說：「謝謝你們。非常感謝你們在漸凍人方面的工作，這對我們來說非常重要。」我說：「但是，我想告訴你們的是，我在觀察你們的肢體語言，我也在聽你們所講的東西。但是看起來似乎是各說各話，沒有太多的協調和聯合。還不止此，怎麼沒有解釋性掛圖寫明要做的事情，後續步驟，以及各方負責的事項？會議結束後，你們會做些什麼？」 然後我轉過身來，差不多有 200 雙眼睛正在注視著我。就在那時，我意識到，我講的這些才是要點，才是最該做的事。就這樣我的使命開始了。接下來的幾年，皮特—我們磕磕絆絆起起落落。皮特接受特許藥物的治療。也是所有漸凍人社群的最後希望。這種藥物還在臨床試驗的第三階段。六個月後，數據回來了：沒有任何療效。我們還以為會有效果，繼續去境外接著治療，但是最後的救命稻草也沒有了。接下來的兩年，我們只能眼睜睜看著兒子一天天，一點點被病魔拖垮。兩年半前，皮特還在棒球場上打全壘打。今天，皮特已經徹底癱瘓了。甚至連頭也抬不起來了。只能蜷縮在電動輪椅上。沒法吞嚥，沒法進食，進食需要進食管。他也不能說話了。他需要通過目控技術和一個語音生成設備來說話，我們在觀察他的肺，因為橫膈膜最終會衰竭，到時候我們就得決定是否給他裝上呼吸器。漸凍人症會吞噬人體的所有器官，但是大腦則保持完整，不受影響。 2014 年 7 月 4 日，盧·賈里格發表振奮人心的演講 75 年後，美國職棒大聯盟邀請皮特在《看台報告》上撰文。非比尋常，因為文章是皮特通過目控技術寫出來的。 20 天後，冰塊開始從冰桶裡面滑落。7 月 27 日，皮特在紐約的室友穿上了「奎恩必勝」的 T 恤，奎因是另一位知名的紐約漸凍人症病人，和印有「波士頓學院」的短褲，說道：「我接受漸凍人症冰桶挑戰，」舉起冰桶，從頭倒下。「我提名...」他提名了波士頓的人繼續接力。那是 7 月 27 日。接下來的幾天，我們的動態消息全是親朋好友發來的。如果你們還沒有往前翻閱，臉書有個很棒的功能，你可以選擇日期，查看當日的內容。一定要看看亞提叔叔的「血腥瑪麗」冰桶挑戰短片。我告訴你們，非常之棒，時間應該就是第二天。第四天左右，我們的網絡管理員大維叔叔，他還沒有臉書帳號，我收到了他發來的短信，問道：「南西，到底是怎麼回事？」每次有人看皮特的網站，戴維叔叔就會收到信息，他的手機響個不停。我們全都坐了下來，我們意識到捐款來了—真是太棒了。 我們知道更多人知道情況後會給我們捐款，我們只是沒有想到會這麼快，幾天的時間就開始了。我們把皮特的網站申請了非營利組織，然後勇往直前。第一周，波士頓媒體開始報導。第二周，全國媒體開始報導。第二周的時候，我們的隔壁鄰居叩開我們的門，從廚房的門縫裡扔進了一個披薩，說：「我覺得你們應該需要吃的。」（笑聲）第三周，各界名流如《今晚娛樂》、《走進好萊塢》開始報導。第四周，全球媒體——英國廣播公司、愛爾蘭電台。你們有人看過《迷失東京》嗎？我先生接受了日本電視台的採訪。非常棒。（笑聲）還有那些短片，點擊率比較高的一些。曲棍球員保羅比瑟內在冰河公園的冰桶挑戰短片，太不可思議了。還有都柏林的修女們的冰桶挑戰，怎麼樣？有人看到那個了嗎？絕對超讚。J.T，賈斯汀·提姆布萊克。這個時候，我們知道，A 咖的大明星們上場了。我翻看我的短信，看到我妹妹發來信息告訴我「賈斯汀！賈斯汀！」德國總理安吉拉·默克爾。不可思議。漸凍人症患者，還有他們的家人，你們知道他們最喜歡的是哪個嗎？每個都喜歡，全都喜歡。因為這一被人誤解，缺乏科研經費的「罕見」疾病，現在人們可以坐下來，看大家一次又一次的提及漸凍人症，漸凍人症。太不可思議了。 那些對此嗤之以鼻的人，我們來看幾個統計數字，好嗎？先說漸凍人症協會，他們相信到年底，可以募集到一億六千萬美元。位在波士頓劍橋的漸凍人症治療開發研究所，募集到了 300 萬美元。出人意料吧？他們已經對一直在研發的一種藥物進行了臨床試驗。三年的經費可以無虞了。兩個月。從開始到現在僅僅兩個月。（掌聲）根據 YouTube 的報導，已經有超過 150 個國家的人們在上面發布冰桶挑戰的短片。臉書上有 250 萬個短片，上周，我參觀了臉書園區，印象深刻，非常壯觀，我告訴那裡的員工，「我知道我家裡的情況，但是這裡情況真是無法想像。」員工們異口同聲地說道，「嚇死你。」 要問我們全家最喜歡的短片是哪個？非比爾·蓋茨的莫屬。因為在皮特的診斷結果出來的當晚，他告訴我們，他要把漸凍人症的情況告訴像比爾·蓋茨這樣的慈善家，現在他做到了。第一個目標，達到。接下來的目標就是治療和治癒了。（掌聲） 這些冰塊從冰桶裡落下來以後，我們知道，這不僅僅是把一桶桶冰水澆到頭上的問題，現在我希望告訴你們一些東西，讓你們能夠銘記於心。第一件事是，每天早上醒來，你可以選擇積極向上地度過這一天。如果我只是蜷縮在床上，蒙頭大睡，什麼也不管了，你們會責怪我嗎？不會，我想你們不會，但是皮特激勵我們每天早上醒來積極向上，全力以赴。我實際上還要推掉一些支援團體，因為他們中的每個人都在說他們在自家的草坪上灑藥，所以才會得漸凍人症，我想說的是：「才不是，」我要遠離這類負能量。 我要告訴你們的第二件事就是，處在困境挑戰中的人一定要有堅強的意志力，去克服困難，戰勝挑戰。皮特還是會去棒球比賽現場，還是會和他的隊友一起坐在休息區，他會把進食袋好好地掛在架子上。你會看到這些孩子，他們會幫他掛。「皮特，這樣掛可以嗎？」「當然。」然後他們把導管放進他的腹部。因為他要讓他們看到現實情況，並且讓他們看到，他絕對不會放棄。 我要告訴你們的第三件事：如果你們有一天遇到不能承受的困境，我希望你們能夠盡量發掘自己內心的感受，找到未來努力的目標和方向，然後堅持不懈地努力。（掌聲）謝謝。（掌聲） 我知道我可能有點超時了，但是我要告訴你們這個：我兒子給我的精神財富。29 年來，我很有幸能做皮特·弗拉特斯的母親。皮特·弗拉特斯一直積極向上，鼓舞他人。他把愛心撒向別人，所有的愛心現在又回到了他身邊。他活在這個世界上，他知道人生的要義。多麼了不起。 我兒子給我的第二個禮物是，他給我了人生的意義。現在我知道我為什麼會在這裡。我要努力救活我兒子，如果時間不夠，我們沒辦法救活他，我也會努力，這樣其他的母親就不用再經歷我所經歷的苦難。 最後卻同等重要的第三件我兒子給我的禮物，也是 2014 年 8 月這個不同尋常的月份的圓滿句點：診斷結果出來當晚他去接的女朋友，現在成了他的妻子，皮特和朱莉生下了我們的孫女，露西·費茲潔拉·弗拉特斯。露西·費茲潔拉·弗拉特斯在 2014 年 8 月 31 日之前兩週降生，為這個月份劃下句點。 所以（掌聲）所以現在讓我把皮特激勵同學、同事和隊友的話留給你們，一定要熱情。一定要真誠。一定要努力。還有不要忘了，一定要優秀。 謝謝你們。（掌聲）
