ken_goldberg_4_lessons_from_robots_about_being_human	"I know this is going to sound strange, but I think robots can inspire us to be better humans. See, I grew up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, the home of Bethlehem Steel. My father was an engineer, and when I was growing up, he would teach me how things worked. We would build projects together, like model rockets and slot cars. Here's the go-kart that we built together. That's me behind the wheel, with my sister and my best friend at the time. And one day, he came home, when I was about 10 years old, and at the dinner table, he announced that for our next project,  we were going to build ... a robot. A robot. Now, I was thrilled about this, because at school, there was a bully named Kevin, and he was picking on me, because I was the only Jewish kid in class. So I couldn't wait to get started to work on this, so I could introduce Kevin to my robot. (Laughter) (Robot noises) (Laughter) But that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind. (Laughter) See, he owned a chromium-plating company, and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals. And so he needed an industrial robot like this, that could basically do the heavy lifting. But my dad didn't get the kind of robot he wanted, either. He and I worked on it for several years, but it was the 1970s, and the technology that was available to amateurs just wasn't there yet. So Dad continued to do this kind of work by hand. And a few years later, he was diagnosed with cancer. You see, what the robot we were trying to build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting. It was a warning about his exposure to the toxic chemicals. He didn't recognize that at the time, and he contracted leukemia. And he died at the age of 45. I was devastated by this. And I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build. When I was at college, I decided to study engineering, like him. And I went to Carnegie Mellon, and I earned my PhD in robotics. I've been studying robots ever since. So what I'd like to tell you about are four robot projects, and how they've inspired me to be a better human. By 1993, I was a young professor at USC, and I was just building up my own robotics lab, and this was the year the World Wide Web came out. And I remember my students were the ones who told me about it, and we would — we were just amazed. We started playing with this, and that afternoon, we realized that we could use this new, universal interface to allow anyone in the world to operate the robot in our lab. So, rather than have it fight or do industrial work, we decided to build a planter, put the robot into the center of it, and we called it the Telegarden. And we had put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the robot, and we wrote some special scripts and software, so that anyone in the world could come in, and by clicking on the screen, they could move the robot around and visit the garden. But we also set up some other software that lets you participate and help us water the garden, remotely. And if you watered it a few times, we'd give you your own seed to plant. Now, this was an engineering project, and we published some papers on the system design of it, but we also thought of it as an art installation. It was invited, after the first year, by the Ars Electronica Museum in Austria, to have it installed in their lobby. And I'm happy to say, it remained online there, 24 hours a day, for almost nine years. That robot was operated by more people than any other robot in history. Now, one day, I got a call out of the blue from a student, who asked a very simple but profound question. He said, ""Is the robot real?"" Now, everyone else had assumed it was, and we knew it was, because we were working with it. But I knew what he meant, because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures of flowers in a garden and then, basically, index them in a computer system, such that it would appear that there was a real robot, when there wasn't. And the more I thought about it, I couldn't think of a good answer for how he could tell the difference. This was right about the time that I was offered a position here at Berkeley. And when I got here, I looked up Hubert Dreyfus, who's a world-renowned professor of philosophy, And I talked with him about this and he said, ""This is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy. It goes back to the Skeptics and up through Descartes. It's the issue of epistemology, the study of how do we know that something is true."" So he and I started working together, and we coined a new term: ""telepistemology,"" the study of knowledge at a distance. We invited leading artists, engineers and philosophers to write essays about this, and the results are collected in this book from MIT Press. So thanks to this student, who questioned what everyone else had assumed to be true, this project taught me an important lesson about life, which is to always question assumptions. Now, the second project I'll tell you about grew out of the Telegarden. As it was operating, my students and I were very interested in how people were interacting with each other, and what they were doing with the garden. So we started thinking: what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other interesting environment? Like, for example, what if it could go to a dinner party at the White House? (Laughter) So, because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface than in the hardware, we decided that, rather than have a robot replace the human to go to the party, we'd have a human replace the robot. We called it the Tele-Actor. We got a human, someone who's very outgoing and gregarious, and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment, cameras and microphones, and then a backpack with wireless Internet connection. And the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment, and then over the Internet, people could experience what she was experiencing. So they could see what she was seeing, but then, more importantly, they could participate, by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go, and then conveying those to the Tele-Actor. So we got a chance to take the Tele-Actor to the Webby Awards in San Francisco. And that year, Sam Donaldson was the host. Just before the curtain went up, I had about 30 seconds to explain to Mr. Donaldson what we were going to do. And I said, ""The Tele-Actor is going to be joining you onstage. This is a new experimental project, and people are watching her on their screens, there's cameras involved and there's microphones and she's got an earbud in her ear, and people over the network are giving her advice about what to do next."" And he said, ""Wait a second. That's what I do."" (Laughter) So he loved the concept, and when the Tele-Actor walked onstage, she walked right up to him, and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips. (Laughter) We were totally surprised — we had no idea that would happen. And he was great, he just gave her a big hug in return, and it worked out great. But that night, as we were packing up, I asked the Tele-Actor, how did the Tele-Directors decide that they would give a kiss to Sam Donaldson? And she said they hadn't. She said, when she was just about to walk onstage, the Tele-Directors still were trying to agree on what to do, and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural. (Laughter) So, the success of the Tele-Actor that night was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor. She knew when to trust her instincts. And so that project taught me another lesson about life, which is that, when in doubt, improvise. (Laughter) Now, the third project grew out of my experience when my father was in the hospital. He was undergoing a treatment — chemotherapy treatments — and there's a related treatment called brachytherapy, where tiny, radioactive seeds are placed into the body to treat cancerous tumors. And the way it's done, as you can see here, is that surgeons insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds. And all these needles are inserted in parallel. So it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs. And as a result, the needles damage these organs, cause damage, which leads to trauma and side effects. So my students and I wondered: what if we could modify the system, so that the needles could come in at different angles? So we simulated this; we developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this. And we were able to show that we are able to avoid the delicate organs, and yet still achieve the coverage of the tumors with the radiation. So now, we're working with doctors at UCSF and engineers at Johns Hopkins, and we're building a robot that has a number of — it's a specialized design with different joints that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles. And as you can see here, they can avoid delicate organs and still reach the targets they're aiming for. So, by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel, this project also taught me an important lesson: When in doubt, when your path is blocked, pivot. And the last project also has to do with medical robotics. And this is something that's grown out of a system called the da Vinci surgical robot. And this is a commercially available device. It's being used in over 2,000 hospitals around the world. The idea is it allows the surgeon to operate comfortably in his own coordinate frame. Many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious, like suturing, and currently, all of these are performed under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon. So the surgeon becomes fatigued over time. And we've been wondering, what if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks, and thereby free the surgeon to focus on the more complicated parts of the surgery, and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster? Now, it's hard to program a robot to do delicate things like this. But it turns out my colleague Pieter Abbeel, who's here at Berkeley, has developed a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example. So he's gotten robots to fly helicopters, do incredibly interesting, beautiful acrobatics, by watching human experts fly them. So we got one of these robots. We started working with Pieter and his students. And we asked a surgeon to perform a task — with the robot. So what we're doing is asking the surgeon to perform the task, and we record the motions of the robot. So here's an example. I'll use tracing out a figure eight as an example. So here's what it looks like when the robot — this is what the robot's path looks like, those three examples. Now, those are much better than what a novice like me could do, but they're still jerky and imprecise. So we record all these examples, the data, and then go through a sequence of steps. First, we use a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition. And this allows us to temporally align all of the examples. And then we apply Kalman filtering, a technique from control theory, that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them. Now we take those human demonstrations — they're all noisy and imperfect — and we extract from them an inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot. We then execute that on the robot, we observe what happens, then we adjust the controls, using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning. Then what we do is we increase the velocity a little bit. We observe the results, adjust the controls again, and observe what happens. And we go through this several rounds. And here's the result. That's the inferred task trajectory, and here's the robot moving at the speed of the human. Here's four times the speed of the human. Here's seven times. And here's the robot operating at 10 times the speed of the human. So we're able to get a robot to perform a delicate task like a surgical subtask, at 10 times the speed of a human. So this project also, because of its involved practicing and learning, doing something over and over again, this project also has a lesson, which is: if you want to do something well, there's no substitute for practice, practice, practice. So these are four of the lessons that I've learned from robots over the years. And the field of robotics has gotten much better over time. Nowadays, high school students can build robots, like the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build. But, it's very — now ... And now, I have a daughter, named Odessa. She's eight years old. And she likes robots, too. Maybe it runs in the family. (Laughter) I wish she could meet my dad. And now I get to teach her how things work, and we get to build projects together. And I wonder what kind of lessons she'll learn from them. Robots are the most human of our machines. They can't solve all of the world's problems, but I think they have something important to teach us. I invite all of you to think about the innovations that you're interested in, the machines that you wish for. And think about what they might be telling you. Because I have a hunch that many of our technological innovations, the devices we dream about, can inspire us to be better humans. Thank you.

(笑聲)比起硬體設備我們對系統設計和使用者平台更感興趣因此我們決定讓人來取代機器人而不是機器人取代人去參加宴會我們稱之為人形機器人 我們找到一個人她非常外向又熱衷社交她戴著一頂頭盔上面有各種設備、攝影機和麥克風背著一個備有無線網路連線功能的背包我們的想法是她可以進入一個有意思的遠距環境人們可以透過網路體驗她所經歷的看到她所看的更重要的是人們可以透過與其他人的互動參與其中關於她該做什麼去哪裡我們想了很多點子並且將這些都傳輸到人形機器人上我們得到機會，把人形機器人帶到在舊金山舉行的威比獎典禮上那年的主持人是山姆．唐納森在幕簾拉開之前我有大概30秒時間向唐納森先生說明我們要做的事我說人形機器人會和你一起出現在舞台上這是一項實驗性的新設計人們會從自己的螢幕上看到她她身上有攝影機和麥克風單邊耳朵會戴耳機她下一步該怎麼做人們會透過網路給她出主意唐納森先生說慢著，那是我的工作(笑聲) 他很喜歡這個概念在人形機器人步上舞台時她直接朝唐納森先生走去並且在他嘴唇上用力親了一下(笑聲)我們都非常驚訝這是我們意料之外的事情唐納森先生人非常好，回給她一個大擁抱得到熱烈的回響當天晚上，在我們打包的時候我問了人形機器人導演是如何決定讓她親山姆‧唐納森的她說他們並沒有要她這麼做她說在她上台之前導演們還在討論要怎麼做所以她就走上台做了她覺得應該做的(笑聲)因此，那晚人形機器人的成功完全歸功於她是個很棒的演員她知道什麼時候該相信自己的直覺這個設計給我上了人生中另一課不確定怎麼做的時候，要隨機應變(笑聲) 第三項設計是源自我父親住院時我個人的經驗當時我父親在接受化療還有另一種相關療法稱為近距放射療法是將微小的放射性種子植入體內來治療癌症腫瘤這個療法正如你所見外科醫師會把針插在人體上來傳遞放射性種子這些插入人體的針呈平行排列因此有些針很容易會刺入敏感的器官結果這些針破壞了器官引起器官損傷及副作用我的學生和我開始想我們是不是可以改善這個系統讓針可以從不同角度插入 我們做了模擬找出最佳的運算法則並再次模擬我們有辦法做到避開脆弱的器官同時仍然能夠維持放射線在腫瘤上的覆蓋範圍 我們現在和加州大學舊金山分校裡的醫生以及約翰霍普金斯大學裡的工程師合作我們正在做一種機器人它經過特殊設計，有許多的關節讓針能夠以各種不同角度插入如你所見，他們可以避開脆弱的器官在需要的地方插針透過對針必須以平行排列有所懷疑我又在這個設計上學到一件事情就是當我們心中有疑問時當你眼前的路受到阻斷時，就換條路走吧(投影片翻譯)1. 要質疑假設2. 猶疑不定時，要隨機應變3. 此路不通時，要繞道而行 最後一個設計也是跟醫學機器人有關這是從一個叫做達文西手術機器人的系統中發展出來的這個設備市面上可以買得到全球已經有超過兩千家醫院使用這項設備這個創意讓外科醫生能夠在屬於自己的空間裡自在地做手術但是許多手術的附加工作比方說縫合，是非常一成不變又沉悶的目前這些工作的執行都是直接由外科醫生專門管控造成外科醫生的過度疲勞我們一直在思考如果我們能設計讓機器人來執行部分的附加工作就可以讓外科醫生專心投入在手術中更複雜的部分如果我們能夠讓機器人的動作加快一些也能夠縮短手術時間 要設計讓機器人做這種精細的工作是很困難的但是我柏克萊大學的同事皮耶特‧阿布比爾做到了他研發出一套讓機器人從實例中學習的新技術透過觀摩專家的飛行他成功讓機器人駕駛直升機做一些有意思又讓人驚艷的特技我們取得一個這種機器人開始和皮耶特還有他的學生一起研究我們請一個外科醫生執行手術我們的做法是和機器人一起我們要求機器人也進行手術然後我們把機器人的一舉一動都錄下來 接下來我用八字縫合做為例子說明這裡有三個例子是由機器人所做的八字縫合這遠比我這個外行人所能做的要強得多但是還是不夠純熟精準 所以我們記錄所有的例子和數據然後仔細看過一連串的步驟首先，我們使用了一個取自語言識別名為動態時間校正的技術這讓我們能夠暫時結合所有的實例接著我們採用卡爾曼濾波器這是一門採自控制理論的技術這個技術讓我們可以對所有雜訊做數據分析節取我們想要的軌跡我們的做法是從這些嘈雜又不盡完美的人體示範中取出套用在機器人身上的任務判別軌跡以及控制程式接著我們在機器人上面執行觀察整個過程然後利用稱為反覆學習的一系列技術來調整控制器接著我們做的是，稍微調快速率我們觀察結果，又調整了控制器再接著觀察我們重覆這個過程好幾次得到這個結果這個是推論的工作軌跡這個則是機器人與人類以同樣速度移動的軌跡這是比人類快四倍的軌跡這是快七倍的這是機器人以比人類快十倍的速度操作的軌跡所以說，我們是有辦法讓機器人用比人類快十倍的速度來執行像手術附加工作這樣的精細工作的因為這個設計包含了練習和學習多次重覆做同一件事情所以這個設計也教了我們一件事情就是如果你想做好一件事情就只能不斷地練習再練習 這些就是這幾年來我從機器人身上學到的四門課至於機器人學這個領域也隨著時間進步了許多如今就連高中學生也能做出像我和我父親嘗試做的那種工業機器人現在我有個女兒名字叫歐妲莎(Odessa)她現在八歲她也喜歡機器人這大概是家族風氣(笑聲)我希望她有機會見到我父親現在換我教她做事情的方法我們一起做很多東西我常常想她能夠從中學到什麼 機器人是所有機器中最具有人性的它們無法解決世界上的所有問題但我認為我們可以從它們身上學到一些重要的事我希望各位去思考那些你感興趣的發明你夢想中的機器想想這些東西可能要傳達的訊息因為我的直覺告訴我許多我們夢想中的科技發明和設備可以啟發我們成為更好的人 謝謝(掌聲)
