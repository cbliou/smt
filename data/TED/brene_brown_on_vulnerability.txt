brene_brown_on_vulnerability	"So, I'll start with this: a couple years ago, an event planner called me because I was going to do a speaking event. And she called, and she said, ""I'm really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer."" And I thought, ""Well, what's the struggle?"" And she said, ""Well, I saw you speak, and I'm going to call you a researcher, I think, but I'm afraid if I call you a researcher, no one will come, because they'll think you're boring and irrelevant."" (Laughter) And I was like, ""Okay."" And she said, ""But the thing I liked about your talk is you're a storyteller. So I think what I'll do is just call you a storyteller."" And of course, the academic, insecure part of me was like, ""You're going to call me a what?"" And she said, ""I'm going to call you a storyteller."" And I was like, ""Why not 'magic pixie'?"" (Laughter) I was like, ""Let me think about this for a second."" I tried to call deep on my courage. And I thought, you know, I am a storyteller. I'm a qualitative researcher. I collect stories; that's what I do. And maybe stories are just data with a soul. And maybe I'm just a storyteller. And so I said, ""You know what? Why don't you just say I'm a researcher-storyteller."" And she went, ""Ha ha. There's no such thing."" (Laughter) So I'm a researcher-storyteller, and I'm going to talk to you today — we're talking about expanding perception — and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that I live and love and work and parent. And this is where my story starts. When I was a young researcher, doctoral student, my first year, I had a research professor who said to us, ""Here's the thing, if you cannot measure it, it does not exist."" And I thought he was just sweet-talking me. I was like, ""Really?"" and he was like, ""Absolutely."" And so you have to understand that I have a bachelor's and a master's in social work, and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work, so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the ""life's messy, love it."" And I'm more of the, ""life's messy, clean it up, organize it and put it into a bento box."" (Laughter) And so to think that I had found my way, to found a career that takes me — really, one of the big sayings in social work is, ""Lean into the discomfort of the work."" And I'm like, knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all A's. That was my mantra. So I was very excited about this. And so I thought, you know what, this is the career for me, because I am interested in some messy topics. But I want to be able to make them not messy. I want to understand them. I want to hack into these things that I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see. So where I started was with connection. Because, by the time you're a social worker for 10 years, what you realize is that connection is why we're here. It's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives. This is what it's all about. It doesn't matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice, mental health and abuse and neglect, what we know is that connection, the ability to feel connected, is — neurobiologically that's how we're wired — it's why we're here. So I thought, you know what, I'm going to start with connection. Well, you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss, and she tells you 37 things that you do really awesome, and one ""opportunity for growth?"" (Laughter) And all you can think about is that opportunity for growth, right? Well, apparently this is the way my work went as well, because, when you ask people about love, they tell you about heartbreak. When you ask people about belonging, they'll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded. And when you ask people about connection, the stories they told me were about disconnection. So very quickly — really about six weeks into this research — I ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that I didn't understand or had never seen. And so I pulled back out of the research and thought, I need to figure out what this is. And it turned out to be shame. And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection: Is there something about me that, if other people know it or see it, that I won't be worthy of connection? The things I can tell you about it: It's universal; we all have it. The only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection. No one wants to talk about it, and the less you talk about it, the more you have it. What underpinned this shame, this ""I'm not good enough,"" — which, we all know that feeling: ""I'm not blank enough. I'm not thin enough, rich enough, beautiful enough, smart enough, promoted enough."" The thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability. This idea of, in order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen, really seen. And you know how I feel about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability. And so I thought, this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick. I'm going in, I'm going to figure this stuff out, I'm going to spend a year, I'm going to totally deconstruct shame, I'm going to understand how vulnerability works, and I'm going to outsmart it. So I was ready, and I was really excited. As you know, it's not going to turn out well. (Laughter) You know this. So, I could tell you a lot about shame, but I'd have to borrow everyone else's time. But here's what I can tell you that it boils down to — and this may be one of the most important things that I've ever learned in the decade of doing this research. My one year turned into six years: Thousands of stories, hundreds of long interviews, focus groups. At one point, people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories — thousands of pieces of data in six years. And I kind of got a handle on it. I kind of understood, this is what shame is, this is how it works. I wrote a book, I published a theory, but something was not okay — and what it was is that, if I roughly took the people I interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness — that's what this comes down to, a sense of worthiness — they have a strong sense of love and belonging — and folks who struggle for it, and folks who are always wondering if they're good enough. There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it. And that was, the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging. That's it. They believe they're worthy. And to me, the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we're not worthy of connection, was something that, personally and professionally, I felt like I needed to understand better. So what I did is I took all of the interviews where I saw worthiness, where I saw people living that way, and just looked at those. What do these people have in common? I have a slight office supply addiction, but that's another talk. So I had a manila folder, and I had a Sharpie, and I was like, what am I going to call this research? And the first words that came to my mind were ""whole-hearted."" These are whole-hearted people, living from this deep sense of worthiness. So I wrote at the top of the manila folder, and I started looking at the data. In fact, I did it first in a four-day, very intensive data analysis, where I went back, pulled the interviews, the stories, pulled the incidents. What's the theme? What's the pattern? My husband left town with the kids because I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing, where I'm just writing and in my researcher mode. And so here's what I found. What they had in common was a sense of courage. And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute. Courage, the original definition of courage, when it first came into the English language — it's from the Latin word ""cor,"" meaning ""heart"" — and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart. And so these folks had, very simply, the courage to be imperfect. They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others, because, as it turns out, we can't practice compassion with other people if we can't treat ourselves kindly. And the last was they had connection, and — this was the hard part — as a result of authenticity, they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were, which you have to absolutely do that for connection. The other thing that they had in common was this: They fully embraced vulnerability. They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful. They didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable, nor did they really talk about it being excruciating — as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing. They just talked about it being necessary. They talked about the willingness to say, ""I love you"" first ... the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees ... the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram. They're willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out. They thought this was fundamental. I personally thought it was betrayal. I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research, where our job — you know, the definition of research is to control and predict, to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict. And now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting. This led to a little breakdown — (Laughter) — which actually looked more like this. (Laughter) And it did. I call it a breakdown; my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening. (Laughter) A spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown, but I assure you, it was a breakdown. And I had to put my data away and go find a therapist. Let me tell you something: you know who you are when you call your friends and say, ""I think I need to see somebody. Do you have any recommendations?"" Because about five of my friends were like, ""Wooo, I wouldn't want to be your therapist."" (Laughter) I was like, ""What does that mean?"" And they're like, ""I'm just saying, you know. Don't bring your measuring stick."" (Laughter) I was like, ""Okay."" So I found a therapist. My first meeting with her, Diana — I brought in my list of the way the whole-hearted live, and I sat down. And she said, ""How are you?"" And I said, ""I'm great. I'm okay."" She said, ""What's going on?"" And this is a therapist who sees therapists, because we have to go to those, because their B.S. meters are good. (Laughter) And so I said, ""Here's the thing, I'm struggling."" And she said, ""What's the struggle?"" And I said, ""Well, I have a vulnerability issue. And I know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness, but it appears that it's also the birthplace of joy, of creativity, of belonging, of love. And I think I have a problem, and I need some help."" And I said, ""But here's the thing: no family stuff, no childhood shit."" (Laughter) ""I just need some strategies."" (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. So she goes like this. (Laughter) And then I said, ""It's bad, right?"" And she said, ""It's neither good nor bad."" (Laughter) ""It just is what it is."" And I said, ""Oh my God, this is going to suck."" (Laughter) And it did, and it didn't. And it took about a year. And you know how there are people that, when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important, that they surrender and walk into it. A: that's not me, and B: I don't even hang out with people like that. (Laughter) For me, it was a yearlong street fight. It was a slugfest. Vulnerability pushed, I pushed back. I lost the fight, but probably won my life back. And so then I went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they, the whole-hearted, what choices they were making, and what we are doing with vulnerability. Why do we struggle with it so much? Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability? No. So this is what I learned. We numb vulnerability — when we're waiting for the call. It was funny, I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook that says, ""How would you define vulnerability? What makes you feel vulnerable?"" And within an hour and a half, I had 150 responses. Because I wanted to know what's out there. Having to ask my husband for help because I'm sick, and we're newly married; initiating sex with my husband; initiating sex with my wife; being turned down; asking someone out; waiting for the doctor to call back; getting laid off; laying off people. This is the world we live in. We live in a vulnerable world. And one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability. And I think there's evidence — and it's not the only reason this evidence exists, but I think it's a huge cause — We are the most in-debt ... obese ... addicted and medicated adult cohort in U.S. history. The problem is — and I learned this from the research — that you cannot selectively numb emotion. You can't say, here's the bad stuff. Here's vulnerability, here's grief, here's shame, here's fear, here's disappointment. I don't want to feel these. I'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. (Laughter) I don't want to feel these. And I know that's knowing laughter. I hack into your lives for a living. God. (Laughter) You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects, our emotions. You cannot selectively numb. So when we numb those, we numb joy, we numb gratitude, we numb happiness. And then, we are miserable, and we are looking for purpose and meaning, and then we feel vulnerable, so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin. And it becomes this dangerous cycle. One of the things that I think we need to think about is why and how we numb. And it doesn't just have to be addiction. The other thing we do is we make everything that's uncertain certain. Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty. ""I'm right, you're wrong. Shut up."" That's it. Just certain. The more afraid we are, the more vulnerable we are, the more afraid we are. This is what politics looks like today. There's no discourse anymore. There's no conversation. There's just blame. You know how blame is described in the research? A way to discharge pain and discomfort. We perfect. If there's anyone who wants their life to look like this, it would be me, but it doesn't work. Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks. (Laughter) Which just, I hope in 100 years, people will look back and go, ""Wow."" (Laughter) And we perfect, most dangerously, our children. Let me tell you what we think about children. They're hardwired for struggle when they get here. And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand, our job is not to say, ""Look at her, she's perfect. My job is just to keep her perfect — make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh."" That's not our job. Our job is to look and say, ""You know what? You're imperfect, and you're wired for struggle, but you are worthy of love and belonging."" That's our job. Show me a generation of kids raised like that, and we'll end the problems, I think, that we see today. We pretend that what we do doesn't have an effect on people. We do that in our personal lives. We do that corporate — whether it's a bailout, an oil spill ... a recall. We pretend like what we're doing doesn't have a huge impact on other people. I would say to companies, this is not our first rodeo, people. We just need you to be authentic and real and say ... ""We're sorry. We'll fix it."" But there's another way, and I'll leave you with this. This is what I have found: To let ourselves be seen, deeply seen, vulnerably seen ... to love with our whole hearts, even though there's no guarantee — and that's really hard, and I can tell you as a parent, that's excruciatingly difficult — to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror, when we're wondering, ""Can I love you this much? Can I believe in this this passionately? Can I be this fierce about this?"" just to be able to stop and, instead of catastrophizing what might happen, to say, ""I'm just so grateful, because to feel this vulnerable means I'm alive."" And the last, which I think is probably the most important, is to believe that we're enough. Because when we work from a place, I believe, that says, ""I'm enough"" ... then we stop screaming and start listening, we're kinder and gentler to the people around us, and we're kinder and gentler to ourselves. That's all I have. Thank you. (Applause)"	"先講個故事幾年前，有個活動策劃打電話給我因為我要辦一個講座她打給我說「我實在想不出來」「在傳單上要怎麼介紹你」我想說「為什麼想不出來？」她答：「看過你演講」「我想應該稱呼你為研究員」「但我怕這樣寫，沒有人會來聽演講」「因為研究員都很無聊、無關緊要」(笑聲)好吧然後她說「但我喜歡你演講的原因」「是因為很像在說故事」「所以我要稱你為說書人」我內心學術、沒安全感那面就跳出來「妳要叫我什麼？」她說：「說故事的人阿」我心想：「何不乾脆叫我魔法小精靈？」(笑聲)「讓我想一下」我鼓起勇氣我想：我是說書人我是定性研究員我工作就是搜集故事也許故事就是有靈魂的數據或許我真的就是說書人我就說：「好吧」「你就叫我研究說書員」她就回：「哈，沒這東西」(笑聲)所以我是個研究說書員我今天要告訴各位的是關於看法的擴展我要分享給各位幾個故事是我研究的一部份這部份徹底的擴展了我的觀點並確實改變了我生活、愛、工作、為人父母的過程 這是我故事的開始當時我還是個年輕的研究員，念博士第一年，我有個教授告訴我們「是這樣的」「你無法測量的，就不存在」我想他只是講些好聽話而已我就說：「真的嗎？」他回：「千真萬確」你們要明白我學士、碩士都念社工我的博士學位也是社工所以我的學術事業都圍繞著一些相信「生活很混亂，愛它吧」的人但我是那種「生活很混亂」「那就收拾整齊」「並收進便當盒裡」的人(笑聲)我想我找到我的路發現一個能帶著我的事業社工常說的一句話偎緊工作令人不舒服的部份我則是那種，遇到不愉快就趕緊想辦法對付他並拿A我這樣催眠自己對此很期待我想，這就是我要做的大事了因為我對這些混亂的話題有興趣但我想讓他們變得不混亂我想搞懂他們我想徹底研究這些我知道很重要的事並把秘密找出來分享給大家 所以我從""連結""開始因為，當了十年社工你會理解到連結就是我們都在此的原因這是我們生命被賦予意義的東西一切都與這相關不管你跟哪個領域的人聊天不論是社會公平、心理健康、 受虐與疏忽照顧我們知道，連結感受到彼此的連結是在神經生物學來說，是我們天生的我們在此的原因所以我想，我要以連結開始研究我想你們都經歷過老闆給的工作評價可能會是37件極佳的表現但有一件是 — 尚待改進(笑聲)你腦子只會想這那尚待改進的事我的研究也是這樣因為當你問人們關於愛的故事他們會告訴你心碎的故事當你問人們關於歸屬的故事他們會告訴你那些他們被排除在外的椎心經驗因為當你問人們關於連結的故事他們會告訴你那些分離的故事 所以很快的，研究開始的六週後就是這件不知如何命名的事讓連結瓦解我不懂也從未見過所以我將研究暫停我想，我一定要知道這是為什麼原來就是羞恥羞恥很好理解就是害怕失去連結我的哪些部份如果外人知道了會不會不想與我往來羞恥，我可以告訴你們是普遍存在的，我們都有那些沒有羞恥心的人沒有同情心與人類連結沒人想談羞恥越不談感受越大鞏固羞恥的東西這種「我不夠好」的感受我想我們都經歷過「不夠徹底、不夠纖瘦」「不夠有錢、不夠漂亮、不夠聰明」「不夠有才」支撐這種極痛苦的脆弱感的是這種為了要有連結我們必須讓自己被看見真的被看見 各位都知道，我恨脆弱所以我想，這是我用量尺贏回來的機會我一定要搞懂這東西我要花一年的時間，破解羞恥我一定要了解脆弱是如何運作我要打敗它我準備好了，也很興奮各位也知道，結果沒有很好(笑聲)你們都懂關於羞恥我可以講很多但會佔用到其他講者的時間我可以告訴你的是，研究最終這是我十年的研究所學到最重要的其中一件事我的一年變成六年數千個故事數百個面談，團體會晤某階段還有人寄給我日記手札告訴我他們的故事六年間有數千筆數據我也大概弄懂了 我有點明白羞恥是什麼是怎麼運作的我寫了本書出版了個理論但有件事還是不對就是我將我訪問過的人分為兩組一組是認為自己有價值的人 —這也是核心的部份個人價值感 —這些人有很強的愛與歸屬感另一組是掙扎的人他們總想自己是否夠好兩組間只有一個可變因素有強烈愛與歸屬感的人與掙扎的人之間只有一個可變因素這就是，那些有強烈愛與歸屬感的人相信他們是值得愛與歸屬的就這樣他們相信這是值得的對我來說，困難的部份唯一讓我們無法連結的部份就是害怕我們不值得彼此連結這個在個人以及工作上來說我覺得我應該要更精確理解所以我將所有的訪談裡看得出個人價值感的案例拿出來只看這些人 這些人有什麼共同點？我對辦公用品有點龜毛但這是另一個故事了我拿了個分類文件夾、一隻簽字筆我就想，這研究要怎麼稱呼?我想到的第一個字就是全心全意這些都是全心付出的人，以強烈價值感活著所以我在資料夾上這樣寫並開始看我所找到的資料事實上我所做的是前四天都密集研究資料回到最初的訪問、故事、事件主題是什麼？模式是什麼？我老公帶孩子出遠門因為我整個廢寢忘食我狂寫資料進入我""研究員模式""我的研究結果是這樣的他們共有的是勇氣(courage)我想簡單解釋勇氣(courage)與勇敢(bravery)的不同勇氣最初的定義最早變成英語的時候是拉丁字源cor，表示""心(heart)""而它最初的定義就是全心全意講述關於你自己的故事所以這些人有著承認不完美的勇氣他們有同情心對自己好之後對別人好因為，後來發現，你要對別人有同情心就一定要先對自己好最後，他們都有著連結這是困難的部份就是""真實性""的結果他們願意放下他們想成為的自己為了做真正的自己而為了與人連結就必須這麼做 他們的另一個共通點是這個他們坦蕩的接受脆弱他們相信讓他們脆弱的會讓他們美麗他們並不是說脆弱是很自在的事也不是很痛心的事從我早期""羞恥""訪問中發現的他們認為脆弱是必須的他們談到願意先說「我愛你」願意去做那些不保證美好的事願意在乳房X光檢查後深呼吸等待醫生回電願意投入一場戀愛不論結果好不好他們認為這是很基本的 我個人認為這是背叛因為我發了誓要做研究研究的定義就是控制和預測、研究現象就這麼簡單控制和預測所以我原本的任務控制和預測變成發現到人們都與脆弱一起生活並停止控制和預測後來導致我有點小崩潰(笑聲)應該是這樣(笑聲)沒錯我稱為崩潰，我心理醫師稱為心靈覺醒心靈覺醒好聽多了不過我確定就是崩潰沒錯所以我把工作放下，去找心理醫師告訴你吧，當你打電話給朋友並問他們：「我想我需要看心理醫生了，你有建議誰嗎？」的時候就瞭解自己是誰了我五個朋友都說「真慶幸我不是你心理醫師」(笑聲)我就說：「你這什麼意思？」他們就說：「我只是說說」「別帶你的量尺就對了」好吧 我找到了個醫師我第一次與Diana的會診我帶上我的清單就是全心全意訪問清單，並坐下她說：「你好嗎？」我說：「我很好阿」她說：「你怎麼了？」我的心理醫師也看心理醫師因為每個人都有心事然後他們胡扯的功力都很厲害(笑聲)然後我說「是這樣的，我在掙扎」她說：「掙扎什麼？」我說：「我跟脆弱槓上了」「我知道脆弱是丟臉和害怕」「的核心」「為了自我價值的掙扎」「但似乎也孕育出了」「喜悅、創造力」「歸屬和愛」「所以我想我遇到困難了」「我需要幫忙」「但是，不要跟我講」「我家庭怎樣」「我童年怎樣的廢話」(笑聲)「告訴我怎麼做就好」(笑聲)(掌聲)謝謝然後她就(笑聲)我問：「很糟吧？」她答：「不好也不壞啦」(笑聲)「不就這樣」我說：「天哪，我完了」 (笑聲) 是也不是啦我看了一年的醫生你們知道有些人在明白脆弱與溫柔很重要之後會舉旗投降A: 這不是我的個性B: 我不跟這種人交朋友(笑聲)對我來說，很像長達幾年的街頭鬥毆打鬥很激烈脆弱揍我，我打回去我輸了但卻贏了我的生活 所以我繼續這個研究花了幾年時間試著搞清楚這些全心全意的人他們所做出的選擇他們怎麼應付脆弱感的為什麼我們如此掙扎？只有我與脆弱掙扎嗎？不是這是我所學到的我們麻痺脆弱例如我們在等待重要電話時蠻好笑的，我在推特和臉書上打了「要如何定義脆弱？」「為什麼會感到脆弱？」大概一個半小時後，我收到150個回覆因為我想知道大家的情形找老公幫忙因為我病了，而且才新婚、向老公求歡、向老婆求歡、被拒絕、邀人去約會、等著醫生回電、被辭退、辭退員工 —這就是我們的生活我們生活在脆弱的世界裡而我們應付脆弱的其中一個方式就是麻痺脆弱感 我認為這是有證據的證據存在不只是唯一理由我認為這是美國史上越來越多負債、肥胖成癮、依賴藥物、成群的很大原因問題是 — 這是我從研究中學到的 —你無法選擇去麻痺情感不能說，我不喜歡這感覺脆弱感、悲傷、羞恥害怕、失望等等我不想要有這種感受去喝啤酒和香蕉堅果鬆餅解悶(笑聲)麻痺這些感覺我知道這笑聲我把你們的生活都研究透徹了天哪被發現了(笑聲)要麻痺難過的感覺就要麻痹憐憫、情感你不能選擇性麻痺當我們麻痺這些我們麻痺喜悅我們麻痺感激我們麻痺快樂之後感到痛苦然後追求目標與意義之後感到脆弱然後去喝啤酒和香蕉堅果鬆餅解悶如此變成惡性循環 我們必須想想我們為什麼、如何麻痺並不一定是因為習慣了我們會做的另一件事是確定那些令人不確定的事宗教已從信仰與神秘變成確定的事我對、你錯、閉嘴就這樣就是確定性我們越怕，就越脆弱然後更害怕有點像現今的政治沒有談話沒有交談只有責怪你們知道研究上怎麼描述""責怪""嗎？釋放痛苦與不安的方式之一我們追求完美世上唯有我希望生活如此但不這麼稱心我們選擇將屁股的脂肪抽出來並拿去豐唇(笑聲)我希望幾百年後的人們會對此瞠目咋舌 (笑聲) 我們追求完美時，最危險的就是要孩子完美跟你們講怎麼對待孩子吧他們生來就得掙扎以達目的當你手上抱著完美的寶寶時我們的工作不是說：「看看她，真完美」「我的工作是讓她保持完美」「確定她五年級時選上網球隊，國一跳級念耶魯」這不是我們的工作我們的工作是看著他們說「你知道嗎？你不完美，你生來就得掙扎」「但你值得愛與歸屬的」這才是我們的工作如果一整代孩子都這麼養那今日的問題都可迎刃而解我們假裝我們所做的對他人沒有影響我們在他人的生活中都是這麼做的還會合作完成—不管是財政援助或油輪漏油、產品回收—我們假裝我們所做的對他人沒有極大的影響大公司們，我們沒這麼好騙我們只要你們老實的說聲「對不起」「我們會彌補」 但還有別的方法的，我留此作結這是我發現的：讓自己被看見最深層的那面脆弱的那面全心全意去愛即使不保證有回報即使很困難尤其身為一個家長，我告訴你們，當我們恐懼時表達感激與喜樂是很痛徹心扉的當我們想：「我能否這麼愛你？」「我能熱情地相信嗎？」「我可以對此勇敢嗎？」的時候能夠停下來，別把一切想的太糟糕然後告訴自己:「我很感激」「因為會感到脆弱代表我還活著」最後，我想最重要的是相信自己足夠了因為如果我們都能相信自己「我夠好了」那我們便會停止抱怨並開始傾聽我們對身邊的人會更溫柔仁慈對自己也會更溫柔仁慈 就這樣，謝謝各位 (掌聲)"
