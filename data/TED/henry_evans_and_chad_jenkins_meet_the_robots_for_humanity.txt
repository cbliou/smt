henry_evans_and_chad_jenkins_meet_the_robots_for_humanity	Sarge Salman: All the way from Los Altos Hills, California, Mr. Henry Evans. (Applause) Henry Evans: Hello. My name is Henry Evans, and until August 29, 2002, I was living my version of the American dream. I grew up in a typical American town near St. Louis. My dad was a lawyer. My mom was a homemaker. My six siblings and I were good kids, but caused our fair share of trouble. After high school, I left home to study and learn more about the world. I went to Notre Dame University and graduated with degrees in accounting and German, including spending a year of study in Austria. Later on, I earned an MBA at Stanford. I married my high school sweetheart, Jane. I am lucky to have her. Together, we raised four wonderful children. I worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder, eventually becoming a chief financial officer in Silicon Valley, a job I really enjoyed. My family and I bought our first and only home on December 13, 2001, a fixer-upper in a beautiful spot of Los Altos Hills, California, from where I am speaking to you now. We were looking forward to rebuilding it, but eight months after we moved in, I suffered a stroke-like attack caused by a birth defect. Overnight, I became a mute quadriplegic at the ripe old age of 40. It took me several years, but with the help of an incredibly supportive family, I finally decided life was still worth living. I became fascinated with using technology to help the severely disabled. Head tracking devices sold commercially by the company Madentec convert my tiny head movements into cursor movements, and enable my use of a regular computer. I can surf the web, exchange email with people, and routinely destroy my friend Steve Cousins in online word games. This technology allows me to remain engaged, mentally active, and feel like I am a part of the world. One day, I was lying in bed watching CNN, when I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp of the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech demonstrating a PR2 robot. I emailed Charlie and Steve Cousins of Willow Garage, and we formed the Robots for Humanity project. For about two years, Robots for Humanity developed ways for me to use the PR2 as my body surrogate. I shaved myself for the first time in 10 years. From my home in California, I shaved Charlie in Atlanta. (Laughter) I handed out Halloween candy. I opened my refrigerator on my own. I began doing tasks around the house. I saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities to live and contribute, both for myself and others in my circumstance. All of us have disabilities in one form or another. For example, if either of us wants to go 60 miles an hour, both of us will need an assistive device called a car. Your disability doesn't make you any less of a person, and neither does mine. By the way, check out my sweet ride. (Laughter) Since birth, we have both suffered from the inability to fly on our own. Last year, Kaijen Hsiao of Willow Garage connected with me Chad Jenkins. Chad showed me how easy it is to purchase and fly aerial drones. It was then I realized that I could also use an aerial drone to expand the worlds of bedridden people through flight, giving a sense of movement and control that is incredible. Using a mouse cursor I control with my head, these web interfaces allow me to see video from the robot and send control commands by pressing buttons in a web browser. With a little practice, I became good enough with this interface to drive around my home on my own. I could look around our garden and see the grapes we are growing. I inspected the solar panels on our roof. (Laughter) One of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone on our basketball hoop. I went even further by seeing if I could use a head-mounted display, the Oculus Rift, as modified by Fighting Walrus, to have an immersive experience controlling the drone. With Chad's group at Brown, I regularly fly drones around his lab several times a week, from my home 3,000 miles away. All work and no fun makes for a dull quadriplegic, so we also find time to play friendly games of robot soccer. (Laughter) I never thought I would be able to casually move around a campus like Brown on my own. I just wish I could afford the tuition. (Laughter) Chad Jenkins: Henry, all joking aside, I bet all of these people here would love to see you fly this drone from your bed in California 3,000 miles away. (Applause) Okay, Henry, have you been to D.C. lately? (Laughter) Are you excited to be at TEDxMidAtlantic? (Laughter) (Applause) Can you show us how excited you are? (Laughter) All right, big finish. Can you show us how good of a pilot you are? (Applause) All right, we still have a little ways to go with that, but I think it shows the promise. What makes Henry's story amazing is it's about understanding Henry's needs, understanding what people in Henry's situation need from technology, and then also understanding what advanced technology can provide, and then bringing those two things together for use in a wise and responsible way. What we're trying to do is democratize robotics, so that anybody can be a part of this. We're providing affordable, off-the-shelf robot platforms such as the A.R. drone, 300 dollars, the Suitable Technologies beam, only 17,000 dollars, along with open-source robotics software so that you can be a part of what we're trying to do. And our hope is that, by providing these tools, that you'll be able to think of better ways to provide movement for the disabled, to provide care for our aging population, to help better educate our children, to think about what the new types of middle class jobs could be for the future, to both monitor and protect our environment, and to explore the universe. Back to you, Henry. HE: Thank you, Chad. With this drone setup, we show the potential for bedridden people to once again be able to explore the outside world, and robotics will eventually provide a level playing field where one is only limited by their mental acuity and imagination, where the disabled are able to perform the same activities as everyone else, and perhaps better, and technology will even allow us to provide an outlet for many people who are presently considered vegetables. One hundred years ago, I would have been treated like a vegetable. Actually, that's not true. I would have died. It is up to us, all of us, to decide how robotics will be used, for good or for evil, for simply replacing people or for making people better, for allowing us to do and enjoy more. Our goal for robotics is to unlock everyone's mental power by making the world more physically accessible to people such as myself and others like me around the globe. With the help of people like you, we can make this dream a reality. Thank you.

(笑聲)我可以在萬聖節發糖果可以自己開冰箱可以幫忙做家事我看到了之前沒看到的可能性活著及貢獻為我自己，也為那些和我一樣的人 所有的人，在某些程度上都有點殘疾舉例來說，如果我們想要以時速60哩前進我們都會需要靠一種叫 ""車"" 的輔助器幫忙你的殘疾，不會否定你的存在我的殘疾也不會對了，來欣賞一下我的愛車出生以來，我們都同樣被限制不能自行飛翔 去年，Willow Garage的蕭凱仁幫我聯繫上了查德‧詹金斯在查德的介紹下，我發現我可以輕易的購買飛行器，自己飛我也在這個時候發現，我可以利用飛行器去改善大家的世界透過飛行器幫助長期臥病在床的人讓他們感覺自己能移動、能掌控真的是很讓人振奮利用我的頭當滑鼠感應我可以透過網路介面看見機器人拍到的影像發號命令只要在網路上點個鈕就可以完成透過練習，我越來越熟悉這個介面我可以在我自己家裡亂晃可以看看我們自己的庭院看看我們種的葡萄我還可以檢查我們屋頂的太陽能板(笑聲)操作這台儀器最大的挑戰是讓這台機器停在我們的籃球框上我甚至去更進一步的嘗試頭戴式的顯示器，Oculus Rift特別由 Fighting Walrus 來修改更進一步的深入體驗飛行器的控制自從在 Brown 跟Chad 團隊一起以來我常常在他們的實驗室飛來飛去遠從3000里外一個禮拜好幾次只工作、沒娛樂的生活會讓人麻痺所以我們都會找時間玩玩遊戲機器人足球(笑聲)我想不到我還能像現在自己自在的在Brown這樣的校園裡走動如果我能付得起學費更好(笑聲) 亨利，歡笑之餘我相信在場的所有人都很想看你遙控這台儀器從距離3000哩外的加州遠端遙控 (掌聲) OK，亨利，你最近有去過D.C.嗎? (笑聲) 來 TEDxMidAtlantic 開心嗎? (笑聲)(掌聲) 可以讓我們看看你有多開心嗎? (笑聲) 好，來個大總結吧現場展現一下你飛行的技巧吧 (掌聲) 好吧，看來我們還是有努力的空間但我想這已經足以讓我們看到願景 亨利的故事之所以動人是因為他讓我們了解他的需求讓我們了解其他跟亨利一樣的人需要什麼樣的科技資源再進一步了解科技能夠提供他們什麼樣的幫助結合兩方的需求創造出一個聰明又有效的方法我們現在想要做的是讓機器人普遍化讓所有的人都能參與其中我們已經開始在販售價位合理的機器人如 A.R. 遙控飛機，一台300美金以及Suitable Technologies 的 beam，只要一萬七美金附贈機器人自由軟體讓大家能夠參與我們的計畫我們希望能透過這些工具讓大家一起想如何幫助身體殘缺的人移動如何關懷我們的高齡化社會如何教育我們的下一代去思考能夠創造什麼樣的新工作給未來的中產階級讓我們能監控並且保護我們的環境同時能夠探索宇宙 場面還給你，亨利 謝謝你，查德 有了這個飛行器，我們便可以看到希望讓長年躺在床上的人能夠再度探索外面的世界機器人會給我們機會公平競爭人類只會受限於自己的心智受限於自己的想像可以讓行動不便的人再次活動別人可以的，他們也可以甚至做得更好這項科技可以提供我們一個行動的管道特別是我們所謂的植物人100年前我會被當作植物人看待但事實上，他們錯了我會死掉 機器人的使用，取決於我們或好或壞是純粹取代人類或是讓我們的生活更好行動不再受限，更能享受生活 我們要讓機器人能夠解放大家的心智讓我們能跟世界互動幫助像我一樣的其他人讓世界各地的人受惠有你們的幫忙我們可以讓夢想成真 謝謝 (掌聲)"
