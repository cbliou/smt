david_hanson_robots_that_relate_to_you	"I'm Dr. David Hanson, and I build robots with character. And by that, I mean that I develop robots that are characters, but also robots that will eventually come to empathize with you. So we're starting with a variety of technologies that have converged into these conversational character robots that can see faces, make eye contact with you, make a full range of facial expressions, understand speech and begin to model how you're feeling and who you are, and build a relationship with you. I developed a series of technologies that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions than previously achieved, on lower power, which enabled the walking biped robots, the first androids. So, it's a full range of facial expressions simulating all the major muscles in the human face, running on very small batteries, extremely lightweight. The materials that allowed the battery-operated facial expressions is a material that we call Frubber, and it actually has three major innovations in the material that allow this to happen. One is hierarchical pores, and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material. There he's starting to walk. This is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. I built the head. They built the body. So the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines, and not just sentience, but empathy. We're working with the Machine Perception Laboratory at the U.C. San Diego. They have this really remarkable facial expression technology that recognizes facial expressions, what facial expressions you're making. It also recognizes where you're looking, your head orientation. We're emulating all the major facial expressions, and then controlling it with the software that we call the Character Engine. And here is a little bit of the technology that's involved in that. In fact, right now — plug it from here, and then plug it in here, and now let's see if it gets my facial expressions. Okay. So I'm smiling. (Laughter) Now I'm frowning. And this is really heavily backlit. Okay, here we go. Oh, it's so sad. Okay, so you smile, frowning. So his perception of your emotional states is very important for machines to effectively become empathetic. Machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing. Right? Those machines have no place for empathy. And there is billions of dollars being spent on that. Character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy. So, if they achieve human level intelligence or, quite possibly, greater than human levels of intelligence, this could be the seeds of hope for our future. So, we've made 20 robots in the last eight years, during the course of getting my Ph.D. And then I started Hanson Robotics, which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing. This is one of our robots that we showed at Wired NextFest a couple of years ago. And it sees multiple people in a scene, remembers where individual people are, and looks from person to person, remembering people. So, we're involving two things. One, the perception of people, and two, the natural interface, the natural form of the interface, so that it's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot. You start to believe that it's alive and aware. So one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff together in an artistic display of an android portrait of science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick, who wrote great works like, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" which was the basis of the movie ""Bladerunner."" In these stories, robots often think that they're human, and they sort of come to life. So we put his writings, letters, his interviews, correspondences, into a huge database of thousands of pages, and then used some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him. And it was kind of spooky, because he would say these things that just sounded like they really understood you. And this is one of the most exciting projects that we're developing, which is a little character that's a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence, friendly machine intelligence. And we're getting this mass-manufactured. We specked it out to actually be doable with a very, very low-cost bill of materials, so that it can become a childhood companion for kids. Interfacing with the Internet, it gets smarter over the years. As artificial intelligence evolves, so does his intelligence. Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. That's incredible. (Applause)"	我是大衛•漢森，我建造具有人格的機器人。而我指的是，我研製出的機器人具有個性，也是個最終會跟你產生共鳴的機器人。所以我們從許多不同的科技開始，這些科技造就了具人格並懂得對話的機器人，它們看得到臉，也會跟你有眼神上的交流，還會做許多種臉部表情，也懂得對話，並且開始仿傚你的感覺，了解你是誰，並與你建立關係。 我發展了一系列的科技，讓機器人做出栩栩如生的臉部表情，比起先前類似的成果，使用較低的電力，這造就了第一代的人型機器人，兩隻腳的機器人。這個機器人有著相當多的臉部表情，仿效著人類臉上的所有主要肌肉，可以靠很小的電池運作，極度輕薄。 讓這電池驅動的臉部表情成真的材料，是我們叫作 Frubber 的材料，這材料有著三種主要創新，讓這項科技得以實現。一個是階層式毛孔。另一個則是材料中的巨分子奈米孔徑。 這是機器人開始在走路。這地點在韓國高等科學技術學院。我做了頭部，他們則做了身體。我的目標是透過機器表達感覺，不只是感覺，神情上也是。 我們和加州大學聖地牙哥分校 (UCSD)的機械感知實驗室 (MPL) 合作。他們具有這項了不起的臉部表情科技，認得各種臉部表情，你所作的各種表情。它還分辨得出你在往哪看，還有你頭的動向。我們模仿所有主要的臉部表情，再用「表情引擎」這個軟體控制機器人。這是以上這些科技的小小展示。 事實上，現在，從這邊插插頭，再從這邊插入，現在我們來看看，它是否讀得到我的臉部表情。OK. 所以我正在微笑。（笑聲）現在我在皺眉頭。這裡的背光相當嚴重。好，可以了。噢，它真難過。OK，當你微笑和皺眉頭時。它對你情緒狀態的察覺是很重要的，這讓機器人可以有效地仿效你的情感。 機器現在變得具有毀滅性的力量，像是殺戮，對吧？那些機器沒有情感。人們卻耗費數十億元在那上頭。我們可以用情感機器人做個開端，使未來機器人真的能具有同理心。所以，如果它們有人類般的智慧，或甚至有可能，比人類的智慧要來得高，這有可能是我們未來希望的開端。 過去八年，在我攻讀博士期間，我們完成了二十個機器人。接著我創立了漢森機器科學公司，為的是大規模生產研發這些科技。這是我們生產的機器人中的一個，我們幾年前在連線雜誌 (Wired) 所舉辦的發明大展 (NextFest) 中展示過。它能同時辨認許多不同的人，記得每個人所在的位置，在人與人間來回注視著，並記得他們。 我們談的有兩件事。一個是人的知覺。另一個是自然的介面，介面原本應有的樣子，所以你跟機器人互動是更直觀的。你開始相信機器人是有生命並有意識的。 所以我最喜歡的主題之一，就是把這些結合起來，用一種藝術性的展示，秀出科幻小說作家菲利普•狄克筆下的機器人，他曾寫出像「機器人是否會夢見機器羊？」這樣精采的作品，電影「銀翼殺手」就是依此小說擴建而來的。在這些故事裡，機器人常常會覺得他們是人類。而且他們總是會獲得生命。所以我們把他的作品、信件、他的訪問、書函，集結成上千頁的資料庫，接著再用一些自然的語言處理，讓你真的可以和他對話。這還真的有點嚇人。因為他會說些事，就好像它們真的懂你。 這正是我們在發展最令人興奮的計畫之一，這是個小角色，一個小機器人，目的是研發友善的人工智慧，友善的機械智慧。我們正在大規模生產這個產品。我們知道這是真的做得到的，用一種相當低成本的材料，這就可以成為孩子童年的夥伴。接上網路，經過歲月，機器人會變得更聰明。在人工智慧演化的同時，這機器人的智慧也會演化。 克里斯•安德森：很謝謝你！真的是太了不起了！（掌聲）
