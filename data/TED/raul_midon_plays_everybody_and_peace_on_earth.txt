(Applause) This is a song that came about because I think it's difficult to be in the world and not be aware of what's going on, and the wars and so forth. This song kind of came out of all of that. And I wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record, which I still stand by, but this has got something else in it. It's called ""Peace on Earth."" ♫ There is no hope. ♫ ♫ There is no future. ♫ ♫ No faith in God to save the day. ♫ ♫ There is no reason, no understanding ♫ ♫ no sacred place to hide away. ♫ ♫ There is no earnest conversation. ♫ ♫ No words of wisdom from the wise. ♫ ♫ There is no reconciliation ♫ ♫ and no collective compromise. ♫ ♫ Peace on Earth, ♫ ♫ that's what we want. ♫ ♫ Peace on Earth, ♫ ♫ that's what we all say. ♫ ♫ Peace on Earth. ♫ ♫ Yet, there in the hallway ♫ ♫ lurks the ghost of war. ♫ ♫ He wants more, and more, and more, and more, ♫ ♫ and more, and more, and more, and more. ♫ ♫ There is no darkness, no sunshine. ♫ ♫ There is no great society. ♫ ♫ There is no freedom without conviction. ♫ ♫ There is no freedom to be free. ♫ ♫ There is no heaven, no fire and brimstone. ♫ ♫ There is no brotherhood of man. ♫ ♫ There is no country, no one religion. ♫ ♫ There is no universal plan. ♫ ♫ Peace on Earth, ♫ ♫ that's what we want. ♫ ♫ Peace on Earth, ♫ ♫ that's what we all say. ♫ ♫ Peace on Earth. ♫ ♫ Yet, there in the hallway ♫ ♫ lurks the ghost of war. ♫ ♫ He wants more, and more, and more, and more, ♫ ♫ and more, and more, and more, and more, and more. ♫ ♫ The answer is ♫ ♫ mutual-assured destruction, ♫ ♫ a balance of power, ♫ ♫ a weapon for everyone. ♫ ♫ Mutual-assured destruction ♫ ♫ bringing peace to everyone. ♫ (Trumpet sounds) (Trumpet sounds) ♫ Peace on Earth, ♫ ♫ that's what we want. ♫ ♫ Peace on Earth, ♫ ♫ that's what we all say. ♫ ♫ Peace on Earth. ♫ ♫ There in the hallway, ♫ ♫ peace on Earth. ♫ ♫ Peace on Earth. ♫ ♫ Peace on Earth. ♫ (Applause)"	♫想像你身處在沒有人的世界♫ ♫四周無人♫ ♫曾經可以聆聽的聲音 可以仰望的面孔♫ ♫已無處可尋♫ ♫無話可說♫ ♫也無人可說♫ ♫噢，來聽我說♫ ♫每個人都可以成為重要的人 ♫ ♫每個人都有改變的自由♫ ♫每個人都可以成為重要的人 ♫ ♫每個人都有改變世界的自由♫ ♫想像一個人人都感受得到自我價值的世界♫ ♫孩童無所不在♫ ♫每個人都有存在於世的原因♫ ♫不解你為何要在意，耶♫ ♫無需多言♫ ♫只有真愛能將我們看透，無論如何♫ ♫噢，來聽我說♫ ♫每個人都可以成為重要的人♫ ♫每個人都有帶來改變的自由♫ ♫每個人都可以成為重要的人 ♫ ♫每個人都有改變的自由♫ ♫你不需要成為一個名人♫ ♫來感受到你靈魂的力量♫ ♫你不需要成為MTV的大明星♫ ♫要了解你眼中的一切只有你自己能看到♫ ♫每個人都可以成為重要的人♫ ♫每個人都有改變世界的自由♫ ♫你可以改變這個世界♫ ♫我可以改變這個世界♫ ♫她可以改變世界♫ ♫他可以改變世界♫ ♫你可以，我可以，她可以，他可以♫ ♫我們可以小小地改變這個世界♫ ♫每個人都可以帶來小小的改變♫ ♫小小的改變♫ ♫每個人都可以帶來小小的改變♫ ♫每個人都可以小小地改變這個世界♫ ♫噢耶♫ （掌聲） 謝謝大家。 （掌聲） 我有了這首歌的靈感是因為我想到如果對世界一無所知還和有戰爭和等等周遭發生的事，是很難在世界生存的。這首歌也因此誕生。我為我的第一張唱片寫了許多歡欣的歌曲，現在我依然堅持著，但這首歌卻有些額外的東西在其中。這首歌名叫做《世界和平》 ♫沒有希望♫ ♫沒有未來♫ ♫沒有信心上帝會拯救世界♫ ♫沒有理由，沒有理解♫ ♫沒有神聖的藏身之處♫ ♫沒有渴求的對話♫ ♫沒有智人的至理名言♫ ♫沒有化解♫ ♫沒有退讓♫ ♫世界和平♫ ♫是我們的要的♫ ♫世界和平♫ ♫是我們的訴求♫ ♫世界和平♫ ♫但在走廊深處♫ ♫仍然潛藏著戰爭的鬼魂♫ ♫他只想要更多、更多、更多♫ ♫更多、更多、更多♫ ♫沒有黑暗，沒有陽光♫ ♫沒有偉大的社會♫ ♫沒有自由的信念♫ ♫沒有解放的自由♫ ♫沒有天堂、沒有烈火與磨難♫ ♫沒有團結在一起的兄弟♫ ♫沒有國家，沒有宗教♫ ♫沒有統一的計畫♫ ♫世界和平♫ ♫是我們的要的♫ ♫世界和平♫ ♫是我們的訴求♫ ♫世界和平♫ ♫但在走廊深處♫ ♫仍然潛藏著戰爭的鬼魂♫ ♫他只想要更多、更多、更多♫ ♫更多、更多、更多♫ ♫結果是♫ ♫兩敗俱傷♫ ♫權力的均衡♫ ♫人人手持武器♫ ♫兩敗俱傷♫ ♫將和平帶給每個人♫ （模仿小號聲） （模仿小號聲） ♫世界和平♫ ♫是我們的要的♫ ♫世界和平♫ ♫是我們的訴求♫ ♫世界和平♫ ♫在走廊深處♫ ♫世界和平♫ ♫世界和平♫ ♫世界和平♫ （掌聲）
