Barry Friedman: There are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today, but this is really, I think, when it reached its peak as far as ergonomics, comfort, design, flexibility ... DH: Now obviously, this is not something we do on our regular show; it's something we just kind of learned for this, so we're going to try. But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs? BF: Nice show, Daniel, nice show. You are the man! Nice show. Man, that was good! DH: Thank you. BF: You know, sometimes when people do those, they go all the way down. You actually just did that. (Laughter) That's the kind of extra effort that's gotten us where we are today ... DH: All right, let's show them something special. BF: ... without a MacArthur grant. Yeah, look at this. You know, all kinds of different ... TED is about invention, let's be honest. Right? DH: Yeah, it is. BF: Last night, Michael Moschen showed some juggling props he has invented and working on. Right now, Dan's going to show something he actually invented. DH: A type of juggling I actually invented, right after I saw another juggler do it. BF: Shut up. (Laughter) DH: And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece. (Laughter) (Applause) Folks, this is shaker cup juggling. It's not a showstopper but it certainly slows it down. BF: Oh yeah, it does. (Drum roll) BF: Oh, Daniel. (Applause) DH: One more? (Drum roll) Perfect. (Drum roll) Perfect. (Drum roll) BF: OK. DH: Oh! All right. (Applause) I'm now pushing my luck: I'm skipping right to six cups. In order to do six cups, I must have perfect control over three with my right hand. (Drum roll) BF: Also three with his left. DH: Perfect. (Laughter) And now, all six cups. Should I do it on the first try or should I miss once on purpose? (Laughter) BF: First try? Once on purpose? (Audience: Once on purpose!) DH: How about if I try first and then decide? BF: Good idea. (Laughter) Let's leave that. We'll leave that door open. (Laughter) (Applause) DH: He's looking at me. BF: That's all right, he does that. All right. DH: Oh! It's time for Richard's help. (Laughter) Oh, good. All right. BF: You know, over the years, every year at the conference, it's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous with Richard. And we've always done something with the bullwhips in our act. It's funny, for years I did it with Daniel holding balloons. And then we thought, ""How stupid."" DH: Excuse me, could we work on the design of the microphone? BF: I think that's the next session. DH: Next session? BF: Yeah. And so we've actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this. He actually assumes more of the danger in this. DH: Please stand up, Richard. (Whip cracks) Oh, sorry. (Laughter) DH: Now Richard, please ... (Whip cracks) BF: OK, sorry. DH: Jesus Christ. Richard, please stand in front of me. Richard Wurman: Can I say something? BF: Sure. RW: In all past years I've rehearsed with them, the things that have happened to me — I have no idea what's going to happen and that's the truth. DH: All right, please stand here in front ... God, I hate that. Put your hands out like this, please. (Laughter) BF: No, come stay up with him. Dan used to actually hold them but now he's got you for protection. It's kind of neat. OK. (Laughter) DH: Wow, you've been working out. BF: No, shut up! (Laughter) Having a little bit of Richard time. That's nice, that's good. OK, here we go. Have him hold your wrist so I can ... DH: Please hold my wrist, will you. BF: Yeah, hold this a minute. There you go. (Laughter) OK. OK, hold on. RW: Hmmm. (Laughter) DH: First one. BF: All those mid-year phone calls are coming back to me now, Richard. (Laughter) DH: So Richard, what were we on the list? Like 1,020? (Laughter) What happened there? BF: I think we were just outside. DH: I don't get it. (Applause) (Laughter) DH: Sorry. BF: Having some bad flashbacks. RW: Do you want me to hold you or not? DH: Don't hold me that hard. BF: Here we go, I'm taking it. (Balloon pops) (Applause) DH: One more, one more. BF: We've got one more we're going to do. RW: Do I get to hold them? BF: You don't want to hold these, trust me. DH: Could you spread your legs a little bit? (Laughter) BF: Gloria, you want to do it? It's very cool. (Laughter) (Applause) (Laughter) One more try. Man, I don't want to get too close. (Laughter) Could you just push that? (Applause) DH: Wow! Boy! BF: That's cool. I always wanted to try that. (Laughter) DH: Let's jump this way, though. Now, we risked Richard's life, it's only fair we risk our own lives. So to do that, I will juggle these three razor-sharp sickles. And if that wasn't enough, and judging by your response, it's not ... (Laughter) DH: Wow! BF: Hoping for a little more build. DH: True. Barry ... BF: I'm going to run up behind him. DH: Leap over my shoulder. BF: Up and over his shoulders. DH: Grab the blades in mid-air, land right there in a pool of blood ... (Laughter) Still juggling. (Laughter) Impossible, you say? BF: Incredible, you say? DH: Why bother, you say? BF: Here we go. DH: Just do it juggler boys, you say? BF: This guy, this guy invented air. DH: I think so, that's right. Even the pencil. BF: He invented the pencil. DH: All right, we'll do this trick, but please remember it took us over 10 years to perfect. BF: Ten years to perfect, which you're about to see. DH: It's not that difficult, we just don't like to practice that much. BF: No, it's a hassle. Traveling too much. Actually, we will take a second to prove — this could be fake — that the blades are indeed razor-sharp. DH: Will someone please throw a small farm animal up onto the stage? (Laughter) Or a virgin for a sacrifice? BF: Anything? DH: Where's Gloria? (Laughter) BF: No, she's got ... farm animal. DH: Do you have a small farm animal? Just trying to play the odds. All right, here we go. BF: Over the top, over the top. DH: How you feeling, Barry? You feeling all right? BF: Yeah, it's all right. DH: Do you feel everything's OK? The atmosphere, the ... BF: Yeah, a little sketchy. DH: Everything up here's OK? BF: Yeah. DH: Then here we go. BF: This one's a little ... Who's doing the lights? Could you point that a little more directly into my eyeballs? Is that possible? (Laughter) I can still see a little. DH: And turn up the intensity; we're still pink in the middle. We went too far. (Laughter) BF: Yeah, it's too far. It's too much of a visual. The design of the body is a whole different thing. DH: Ready, Barry? BF: Over the top. DH: May we have our jumping music please? (Silence) May we have it a bit louder? (Laughter) BF: They're a good crew! Whoa! DH: Whoa, sorry. All right. BF: We're going on. DH: All right, we'll try again. BF: All right? Oh my gosh. Oh. DH: All right, here we go. Sorry about that. BF: I thought I had the hard part. OK. DH: Whenever you're ready. BF: There we go! (Applause) All right, get up! Come on and dance! DH: Dance, come on. BF: Come on and dance! Somebody dance! Come on! (Applause) Wow, wow, OK, stop. Weird, no one dances. We're two guys doing this. (Laughter) I think that's uncomfortable for everyone. DH: The French judge ... BF: One more quick thing. DH: The French judge gives it a 5.2. (Laughter) BF: Well, you know ... DH: There you go ... BF: Oh, yeah. Another one coming in. DH: Tell them about our bio and stuff. BF: Yeah. In our bio, some of you may have read that we've won two world juggling championships. And believe it or not, you don't win juggling champions for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups. We're going to show you right now an excerpt from a routine that we used to wipe out the other juggling team competition. DH: That's right. BF: Good. DH: I know what you're thinking: other juggling teams must really suck. (Laughter) BF: Juggling's got a bad rap. DH: But wait, Barry, there's still one more club lying there by my foot. And look, it has a twin! BF: Shut up. (Laughter) DH: There's still one more by my foot. What do you want me to do with it? BF: Richard you tell him, it's your last year. (Laughter) DH: That's a pretty good setup, Richard. BF: Yeah, it's a good setup. That's a big setup. DH: You can't get any better than that. All right. What I will do: I will use my panther-like reflexes. BF: Nice. DH: I got that — to reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel. BF: Nice. DH: I touched it, Barry. That should be enough. BF: It's progress, that's the thing. (Laughter) DH: How about that? I'll do it again. Oh wait, it's on your side, Barry. And it's awfully windy over there. BF: It is, it's weird. You wouldn't think it would affect half the stage, but it is. It's weird. Watch this: what I'm going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot. DH: Wow! What a great trick, Barry! Oh, look how it lies there. Oh, Barry, is there nothing you can't do? (Laughter) You are my hero. You're my Jim Shea, Jr. Too much Olympics. BF: From my foot, I'll attempt to kick the seventh club. Here we go. DH: Where, Barry? Where? Tell us, Barry. [Unclear] eagerly awaits your next syllable. What will it be? What gem of knowledge? What pearl of wisdom? Do you want to buy a vowel, Barry? Is that your final answer? BF: All right! You have to turn off the TV from time to time. DH: I do, I do. BF: From my foot, the kick up in the seven. DH: We will juggle seven. BF: From six to seven. DH: That's a world's record. BF: Really? DH: For us. BF: Yes. DH: Whenever you're ready there, big guy. Put your tongue away, Barry. BF: Oh, oh, whoa. (Applause) DH: Please, please stay seated. Stay seated. Thank you. Because now, to make this twice as difficult, we'll juggle the seven clubs back ... BF: Seven-club juggling. DH: ... to back. BF: Thank you, that's it. BF: Thank you guys! DH: Thank you very much!"	請把懶骨頭丟給我，我們開始吧。 現今有很多種高科技的椅子，但是這個真的，我覺得，真的達到高科技的巔峰它符合人體工學、舒適、具有設計感並且很有彈性呢！ 現在，很明顯地，這不是我們平常在做的秀。這算是我們特地為了這個表演學的吧。所以我們要開始試了。但是我們可以為了懶骨頭來些振奮人心的音樂嗎？ 好啊，Daniel，做的好。你做的真的很不錯。做得好！ 就是這樣！謝啦。有時候人們做這些事啊，他們都會盡量讓身體貼到地板，但是你其實只是稍微做一下而已！就是付出這樣的努力才讓我們達到今日的地位。 好了，我們來做些特別的好了！ 只差沒有獲得MacArthur獎。沒錯，看這。你知道各式各樣的(道具)老實說TED就是說一些有關發明的事。 DH：是的。 Michael Moschen前一晚秀出了一些雜耍道具他之前發明的而且現在還想研發一些更好的出來。現在，Daniel將要表演他所發明的， 一種我發明的雜耍特技，不久後，我看到其他表演者做這項表演。 夠了。 這只是一段完整表演中的一小段啦。 (笑聲) (鼓掌) 各位，這是一個雪克杯雜耍，不是表演終結者，但它確實會冷場。 噢！沒錯！噢，Daniel！ (鼓掌) 再一個。很好！漂亮！做得好！ (鼓掌) 我要來試試我的運氣。 接下來我要直接一次耍六個杯子！現在一次有六個杯子，我得控制得很好才行。三個在我的右手。 另外三個在左手。 沒錯。 (笑聲) 那現在，六個杯子。我應該要第一次做就全部成功，還是我應該要故意失誤一次？ 要一次就成功還是故意失誤一次？ 觀眾: 故意失誤一次！ 還是我先試一次看看再決定？ 好主意！我們先暫時保留這個決定。 (笑聲) 他在看我耶。 沒關係啦，他都這樣。沒事的，噢。 是時候要Richard的幫忙了。喔，好阿，也是。 你知道嗎，這麼多年下來，每一年在記者會上，跟Richard做一些危險的事情好像變成我們的傳統，而且在我們表演裡都做一些和鞭子有關的事。有趣的是，這些年來Daniel都拿著氣球配合著我。然後我們就想說：「多麼愚蠢啊。」 不好意思，可以改善一下麥克風的設計嗎？ 我想那是下一場的主題。 下一場？ 是的，而且其實我們在這件事上，已經找到一個可以跟Richard合作的方法了。這件事情對他來說其實更危險。 請站起來，Richard。 (笑聲) 現在，Richard，麻煩請你... 好，抱歉。 天阿Ricahrd！ 麻煩請你站到我身前。 我可以說一些話嗎？當然可以。 在過去這麼多年來，我一直都跟他們一起排練一些表演那些我所經歷過的，但是這一次，說真的，我真的不知道接下來會發生什麼事。 是，拜託請站到這個前面...天啊，我恨這樣！麻煩把你的手像這樣打開。 (笑聲) 往前，靠近他一點。通常是Dan拿著氣球，但現在有他被抓來站在前面保護你。這樣感覺很棒。 (笑聲) 哇，你一直都有在健身耶。 才沒有，閉嘴啦。 (笑聲) 有一些可以跟Richard相處的時間耶，還不錯啦，這樣很好。好，我們開始吧！讓他抓著你的手腕，這樣我就可以... 請抓著我的手，抓一下。 開始嘍！ (笑聲)好的。 好，等一下哦。 嗯...... (笑聲) 第一個 我現在想到你在年中打給我的奪命連環call了，Richard。 (笑聲) 所以，Richard，我們是在名單的哪裡啊？是1020號嗎？ (笑聲) 發生什麼事了嗎? 我想我們其實差一點就在名單裡面了。 (鼓掌) (笑聲) 我有一種不好的預感... 不要把我抓這麼緊啦！ 來吧，我會打中。 再一個、再一個。 我們還有一個要做的。 我可以拿住他們嗎？ 可以阿，但你不會想抓住它們的，相信我。 你可以把你的腳張開一點嗎？ (笑聲) Gloria你想做嗎？這很酷耶。 (笑聲) (掌聲) (笑聲) 再試一次吧，我不想打到太接近他那邊。 (笑聲) 你可以縮一下小腹嗎？ (掌聲) 哇！ 太酷了！ 其實我一直想試著那樣做。 (笑聲) 從這個方向跳好了。剛剛我們拿Richard的生命開玩笑，現在很公平的，我們自己也來冒險看看！所以，我要用三把鋒利鐮刀做一個特技。如果這樣還不夠，我會依大家的反應做判斷。這不是... (笑聲) 哇！希望你這樣有讓觀眾覺得更緊張刺激一點。 真的！ 我會先在他後面助跑， 他會跳過我的肩膀。 對，跳過他的肩膀。 然後抓住半空中的鐮刀！ 然後地上會有一攤血！ (笑聲) 然後繼續表演。你是不是覺得不可能啊？ 你也覺得不可思議對吧？ 你是不是覺得這麼危險的事情為什麼要去做啊？ 我們開始吧！ 你們就做吧，雜耍小子！ 這個人，這個人發明空氣。我也這麼覺得耶。連鉛筆也是。 他發明鉛筆。 好，我們現在要開始了，但是請記住我們花了十年的時間才把它練成。 沒錯，你們等一下看到的那個特技我們花了十年才練好。 其實這也沒有很難啦，只是我們不喜歡太常練習而已啦。 麻煩的是，太常巡迴。我們要不要給觀眾驗證，這鐮刀可能是假的啊？開玩笑的啦，它真的是一把鋒利的刀！ 有人要丟隻小豬或小羊上來試試看的嗎？丟到台上來！ (笑聲) 還是要犧牲一個處女？ 任何東西都可以喔。 Gloria人呢？ 她去抓小動物了啦！ 你有隻農場小動物喔？就賭賭看啦。好啦，我們開始吧。 從上面跳過去！跳過去哦！ 你現在感覺如何啊Barry？你還好吧？ 是的。 一切都就緒了嗎？ 氣氛？或是？ 恩，還可以。 上面工作人員都準備好了嗎？ 嗯。 那我們開始嘍！ 這裡好像有一點點... 燈光師是哪位呀？ 可以請你...這個燈泡正對著我...你打光可以再直接打進我眼睛一點沒關係，我真的快瞎了。 光熱度需要再強一點，我們還沒被煮熟。我們開玩笑開得太過分了啦。 真的，太誇張了。這樣講起來太寫實了啦。身體上的設計，那可是完全不同的東西。 DH: Barry準備好了嗎？ BF: 從上面來喔。 麻煩放一下我們那個jumping的音樂，謝啦！可以再大聲一點嗎？ (笑聲) 我們的工作人員實在太優秀了！ 噢！噢！噢！沒關係。沒關係。 繼續。 沒關係，再試一次。 可以了嗎？ 噢我的天啊。 很抱歉剛剛失誤了。 我以為我的部分比較困難。來吧！ 你準備好了就來吧！ 我們做到了！ (掌聲) 來吧來吧！ 大家一起跳舞慶祝一下！快快快！誰來跳一下？ (掌聲) 好了好了，夠了。大家都沒跟著跳，只有我們兩個跳好奇怪喔。我想大家應該覺得很尷尬吧。 法籍裁判 有個更快的方式。 法國裁判給5.2分。 (笑聲) 恩，你知道的 DH：那你繼續— BF：好的，下一個。 跟觀眾說一些我們的經歷好了！ 好啊！ 你們有些人或許早就看過我們的經歷了，我們得過兩次世界雜耍冠軍。信不信由你啦！沒有人靠耍長鞭或接雪克杯贏得雜耍冠軍。我們現在就表演一小段我們贏過其他隊伍的特技片段給大家看看！. 沒錯！ 很好！ 我知道你們在想什麼：你們一定覺得其他雜耍隊伍很爛。 (笑聲) 雜耍的評價很低。 等一下，Barry，現在還有一根棒子在我腳邊耶！你看，它還有一個雙胞胎弟弟欸！ (笑聲) 但還有一根棒子在我腳邊。你要我怎麼做啊？ Richard你告訴他啦，這是你最後一年了！ 這是個相當好的安排，Richard。 是啊，是個很好的安排！是個成功的安排。 好的，我現在要用— 像豹一樣靈敏的反應把它撿起來！ 很好！ 我撿到了！蹲下去然後緊緊抓住棒子。 很好。 欸Barry我碰到它了！ 這樣應該夠了吧！ 重點是你進步了！ (笑聲) 如何？你也試一次看看。噢！在你那邊了耶，Barry！你那邊風很大欸。 真的！太奇怪了！你沒想到它居然只影響半個舞臺吧。是真的！很奇怪耶！看這個，我要將第七個棒子滑到我腳上。 哇！這個技巧也太棒了吧Barry！哇，看它怎麼躺在那邊的。噢Barry，有你做不到的事嗎？ (笑聲) 你是我的英雄，我的Jim Shea Jr.你奧運比賽看太多了。 我要把第七根棒子用腳踢起來！ 在哪裡，Barry？在哪裡？快點告訴我們！好想知道你要說什麼呢！會是什麼呢？有什麼名言錦句？有什麼金玉良言？Barry你要買一個母音嗎？這是你最後的答案嗎？ 好，你偶爾需要把電視關掉！ 沒錯，沒錯。從我的腳邊踢上第七個。然後一次雜耍七根棒子！ BF:從第六個到第七個 DH:對我們而言是個世界紀錄。 沒錯！ 你準備好就開始吧！把你的舌頭收進去，Barry。 噢噢噢！ (掌聲) 大家請坐好，請坐好！謝謝！因為我們現在要表演難度比這個更高的！我們會背對背耍七根棒子 七根棒子的雜耍 背對背哦。 謝謝！就像這樣！ 謝謝大家！ 謝謝！
