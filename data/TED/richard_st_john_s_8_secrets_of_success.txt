richard_st_john_s_8_secrets_of_success	"This is really a two-hour presentation I give to high school students, cut down to three minutes. And it all started one day on a plane, on my way to TED, seven years ago. And in the seat next to me was a high school student, a teenager, and she came from a really poor family. And she wanted to make something of her life, and she asked me a simple little question. She said, ""What leads to success?"" And I felt really badly, because I couldn't give her a good answer. So I get off the plane, and I come to TED. And I think, jeez, I'm in the middle of a room of successful people! So why don't I ask them what helped them succeed, and pass it on to kids? So here we are, seven years, 500 interviews later, and I'm going to tell you what really leads to success and makes TEDsters tick. And the first thing is passion. Freeman Thomas says, ""I'm driven by my passion."" TEDsters do it for love; they don't do it for money. Carol Coletta says, ""I would pay someone to do what I do."" And the interesting thing is: if you do it for love, the money comes anyway. Work! Rupert Murdoch said to me, ""It's all hard work. Nothing comes easily. But I have a lot of fun."" Did he say fun? Rupert? Yes! (Laughter) TEDsters do have fun working. And they work hard. I figured, they're not workaholics. They're workafrolics. (Laughter) Good! (Applause) Alex Garden says, ""To be successful, put your nose down in something and get damn good at it."" There's no magic; it's practice, practice, practice. And it's focus. Norman Jewison said to me, ""I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing."" And push! David Gallo says, ""Push yourself. Physically, mentally, you've got to push, push, push."" You've got to push through shyness and self-doubt. Goldie Hawn says, ""I always had self-doubts. I wasn't good enough; I wasn't smart enough. I didn't think I'd make it."" Now it's not always easy to push yourself, and that's why they invented mothers. (Laughter) (Applause) Frank Gehry said to me, ""My mother pushed me."" (Laughter) Serve! Sherwin Nuland says, ""It was a privilege to serve as a doctor."" A lot of kids want to be millionaires. The first thing I say is: ""OK, well you can't serve yourself; you've got to serve others something of value. Because that's the way people really get rich."" Ideas! TEDster Bill Gates says, ""I had an idea: founding the first micro-computer software company."" I'd say it was a pretty good idea. And there's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas — it's just doing some very simple things. And I give lots of evidence. Persist! Joe Kraus says, ""Persistence is the number one reason for our success."" You've got to persist through failure. You've got to persist through crap! Which of course means ""Criticism, Rejection, Assholes and Pressure."" (Laughter) So, the answer to this question is simple: Pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED. (Laughter) Or failing that, do the eight things — and trust me, these are the big eight things that lead to success. Thank you TEDsters for all your interviews! (Applause)"	這原來是為高中生準備的兩小時演講，現在精簡成三分鐘。一切都得從我搭機來參加 TED 那天說起。那是 7 年前了，在機上我隔壁坐了一個高中生，一個青少年。她家很窮，不過她希望這輩子能有所成就。所以就問了我一個簡單的問題，她問：怎樣才能成功？我感覺好糟糕。因為我說不出個好答案。最後我下了飛機，到了 TED 會場。突然想到，老天，這個地方滿是成功的人！為什麼不問問他們成功的祕訣？然後再告訴孩子們呢？經過 7 年 5 百次訪談後，我將告訴大家真正的成功之道，並以成功的 TED-ster 為例子。第一項就是「熱情」。汽車設計師費曼‧湯瑪斯曾說：熱情就是我的動力。TED-ster 做事絕非出於「利」，而是出自熱愛。城市設計師凱若‧柯麗塔說：我願意付錢讓別人做我的工作。有趣的是，出自熱愛做的事，一定會獲利。努力！媒體大亨梅鐸告訴我：全靠努力。無事可輕鬆獲得。不過，我從中得到許多樂趣」。他說了「樂趣」嗎？梅鐸？沒錯！TED-ster 從工作中得到樂趣，而且他們非常努力。我發現，他們不是工作狂而是「工作玩家」。成為高手！電玩開發高手愛力克斯‧嘉登說：要成功，先得立定目標。然後讓自己成為高手。一切沒有捷徑，只有練習、練習再練習。專注！製片諾曼‧喬森跟我說：我認為一切都跟能多專注在一件事有上有關。狠勁！劇場美術設計師大衛‧高羅說：對自己狠一點！體能上，心智上，都必須不斷的突破、突破再突破。要狠下心克服害羞跟自我懷疑。歌蒂·韓說：我向來懷疑自己，我不夠好、不夠聰明、我不覺得自己會成功。時時狠下心逼自己並不容易。因此，「母親」就派上用場啦。（全場大笑）建築大師法蘭克‧蓋瑞告訴我：我母親督促我。服務！醫生作家薛文‧諾藍說：我有幸能當醫生為大家服務。很多孩子們跟我說想成為百萬富翁，我回答他們的第一句話就是：好，不過你不能只服務自己。你必須先為別人提供有價值的服務。因為只有這樣才能真正富有。想法。TED-ster 比爾·蓋茲說：我有個想法。想創立世界第一個微電腦軟體公司。我覺得那是個非常棒的想法。創意靈感的產生沒有捷徑，就是做這些非常簡單的事。正如投影片上列出的建議。毅力！軟體商喬‧庫斯說：有毅力才會成功。即使失敗，也要有毅力撐過去。要有毅力撐過爛事 (CRAP) ！也就是批評 (C)、拒絕 (R)、爛人 (A) 與壓力 (P)（全場大笑）所以，這個大問題的答案非常簡單。花 4 千美元參加 TED 演講、要不就得做到這 8 點，而且我保證這 8 點就是邁向成功的原則。謝謝所有參與訪談的 TED-ster ！
