And I thought that if time could reach forwards and backwards infinitely, doesn't that mean that every point in time is really infinitely small, and therefore somewhat meaningless. So we don't really have a place in the universe, as far as on a time line. But nothing else does either. Therefore every moment really is the most important moment that's ever happened, including this moment right now. And so therefore this music you're about to hear is maybe the most important music you'll ever hear in your life. (Laughter) (Applause) (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) For those of you who I'll be fortunate enough to meet afterwards, you could please refrain from saying, ""Oh my god, you're so much shorter in real life."" (Laughter) Because it's like the stage is an optical illusion, for some reason. (Laughter) Somewhat like the curving of the universe. I don't know what it is. I get asked in interviews a lot, ""My god, you're guitars are so gigantic!"" (Laughter) ""You must get them custom made — special, humongous guitars."" (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause)"	在童年時，我經常想到在宇宙中我是處在什麼地位，以及我對 “無限” 含義。的初始想法我認為如果時間能夠向前後無限延伸，那是不是就意味著時間裡的每一點都無限地小？因此，用點來看時間是沒有意義的所以說，只要我們身處在時間線上， 我們在這宇宙中真的沒有什麼地位可言。不過其他的一切也是如此。因此，當下發生的其實都是最重要的包括現在這一時刻。所以，你將要聽到的這段音樂可能也是你生命中聽到的最重要的音樂。 （笑聲） （鼓掌） （鼓掌）謝謝。（鼓掌） （鼓掌） 要是我之後有幸再碰見你們中一些人，拜託千萬不要發出“天哪，你實際怎麼這麼矮！”的感嘆（笑聲）因為某些原因，舞臺就像一個幻影。（笑聲）也像宇宙的曲線。 我不知道那是什麼。我常常在做訪問時被問到：“天哪，你的吉他怎麼這麼大！”（笑聲）“這麼大而獨特的吉他，你一定是特別訂做的。” （笑聲） （鼓掌）謝謝你們。（鼓掌）
