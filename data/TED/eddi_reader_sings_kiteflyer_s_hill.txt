So this is another one dedicated to that guy ... who I've got over. But this is ""Kiteflyer's Hill."" It's a beautiful song written by a guy called Martin Evan, actually, for me. Boo Hewerdine, Thomas Dolby, thank you very much for inviting me. It's been a blessing singing for you. Thank you very much. ♫ Do you remember when we used to go ♫ ♫ up to Kiteflyer's Hill? ♫ ♫ Those summer nights, so still ♫ ♫ with all of the city beneath us ♫ ♫ and all of our lives ahead ♫ ♫ before cruel and foolish words ♫ ♫ were cruelly and foolishly said ♫ ♫ Some nights I think of you ♫ ♫ and then I go up ♫ ♫ on Kiteflyer's Hill ♫ ♫ wrapped up against the winter chill ♫ ♫ And somewhere in the city beneath me ♫ ♫ you lie asleep in your bed ♫ ♫ and I wonder if ever just briefly ♫ ♫ do I creep in your dreams now and then ♫ ♫ Where are you now? ♫ ♫ My wild summer love ♫ ♫ Where are you now? ♫ ♫ Have the years been kind? ♫ ♫ And do you think of me sometimes ♫ ♫ up on Kiteflyer's Hill? ♫ ♫ Oh, I pray you one day will ♫ ♫ We won't say a word ♫ ♫ We won't need them ♫ ♫ Sometimes silence is best ♫ ♫ We'll just stand in the still of the evening ♫ ♫ and whisper farewell to loneliness ♫ ♫ Where are you now? ♫ ♫ My wild summer love ♫ ♫ Where are you now? ♫ ♫ Do you think of me sometimes? ♫ ♫ And do you ever make that climb? ♫ ♫ Where are you now? ♫ ♫ My wild summer love ♫ ♫ Where are you now? ♫ ♫ Have the years been kind? ♫ ♫ And do you ever make that climb ♫ ♫ up on Kiteflyer's Hill? Kiteflyer's ... ♫ ♫ [French] ♫ ♫ Where are you? Where are you now? ♫ ♫ Where are you now? ♫ ♫ Kiteflyer's ... ♫ (Applause) Gracias. Thank you very much."	這發生在倫敦的一個地方，叫風箏山，我以前經常去那裡，不停地問著：“他甚麼時候回來？他甚麼時候回來？”所以這首歌是獻給那男的...那個我曾經愛過的人。這首歌叫“風箏山”。這首優美的歌曲是由馬丁．埃文創作，其實是為我寫的。 布．希沃汀，湯瑪斯．道比，感謝你們邀請我來。很榮幸能為你們唱歌。非常感謝。 ♫還記得以前我們經常去♫ ♫風箏山♫ ♫夏夜是那麼的平靜♫ ♫整座城市都在我們的腳底下♫ ♫還有我們的未來♫ ♫直到我們說出那些♫ ♫無情的話語和幼稚的字眼♫ ♫有時我在夜晚會想起你♫ ♫然後我就會去♫ ♫風箏山♫ ♫寒冷的冬風包圍著我♫ ♫而你卻在我腳下城市的某一處♫ ♫躺在床上熟睡♫ ♫我在想著，我是否曾經♫ ♫出現在你的夢中♫ ♫你現在在哪裡呢？♫ ♫我那瘋狂夏日的愛♫ ♫你現在在哪裡呢？♫ ♫你這些年過得好嗎?♫ ♫你到風箏山時♫ ♫是否會想起我？♫ ♫喔，我希望有一天你會如此♫ ♫我們不用說任何話♫ ♫我們不需要任何話語♫ ♫有時候，沉默是最好的選擇♫ ♫讓我們在平靜的夜晚♫ ♫悄悄地與寂寞告別♫ ♫你現在在哪裡呢？♫ ♫我那瘋狂夏日的愛♫ ♫你現在在哪裡呢？♫ ♫你是否偶爾會想起我♫ ♫你是否曾再回到風箏山♫ ♫你現在在哪裡呢？♫ ♫我那瘋狂夏日的愛♫ ♫你現在在哪裡呢？♫ ♫這些年你過得好嗎?♫ ♫你是否曾再回到♫ ♫回到風箏山上♫ ♫風箏山...♫ ♫你在哪裡？你現在在哪裡呢？♫ ♫你現在在哪裡呢？♫ ♫風箏山...♫ （掌聲） 謝謝，非常的謝謝你們。
