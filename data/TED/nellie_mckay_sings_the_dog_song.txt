nellie_mckay_sings_the_dog_song	"I’d like to dedicate this next song to Carmelo, who was put to sleep a couple of days ago, because he got too old. But apparently he was a very nice dog and he always let the cat sleep in the dog bed. ♫ (Dog panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. ♫ ♫ I'm just a'walking my dog, singing my song, strolling along. ♫ ♫ Yeah, it's just me and my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong. ♫ ♫ My life was lonely and blue. ♫ ♫ Yeah, I was sad as a sailor, ♫ ♫ I was an angry 'un too. ♫ ♫ Then there was you — appeared when I was entangled with youth and fear, ♫ ♫ and nerves jingle jangled, vermouth and beer were getting me mangled up. ♫ ♫ But then I looked in your eyes ♫ ♫ and I was no more a failure. ♫ ♫ You looked so wacky and wise. ♫ ♫ And I said, ""Lord, I'm happy, 'cause I'm just a'walking my dog, ♫ ♫ catching some sun. We can't go wrong."" ♫ ♫ Yeah, it's just me and my dog, singing our song, strolling along. ♫ ♫ 'Cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt, ♫ ♫ and I don't care what the politicians spout. ♫ ♫ If you need a companion, why, just go out to the pound, ♫ ♫ and find yourself a hound, and make that doggie proud, ♫ ♫ 'cause that's what it's all about. ♫ ♫ (Dog panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. ♫ ♫ My life was tragic and sad. ♫ ♫ I was the archetypal loser. ♫ ♫ I was a pageant gone bad. ♫ ♫ And then there was you — on time, and wagging your tail ♫ ♫ in the cutest mime that you was in jail. ♫ ♫ I said, ""Woof, be mine!"" and you gave a wail and then ♫ ♫ I was no longer alone. ♫ ♫ And I was no more a boozer. ♫ ♫ We'll make the happiest home. ♫ ♫ And I said, ""Lord, I'm happy, 'cause I’m just a'walking my dog, ♫ ♫ singing my song, strolling along."" ♫ ♫ Yeah, it's just me and my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong, ♫ ♫ 'cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt, ♫ ♫ and I don’t care what the politicians spout. ♫ ♫ If you need a companion, why, just go out to the pound, ♫ ♫ and find yourself a hound, and make that doggie proud, ♫ ♫ 'cause that's what it's all about, ♫ ♫ that's what it's all about, ♫ ♫ that's what it's all abou-BOW-WOW-WOW-WOW ♫ ♫ that's what it's all about. ♫ ♫ (Dog panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. ♫ Good dog! Thank you."	我想把下一首歌獻給卡梅羅，幾天前他們讓牠安樂死，因爲牠太老了。牠看來是一隻非常好的狗，牠總是讓貓睡牠的床。 ♫(狗的喘息聲) 哈，哈，哈，哈，哈，哈，哈，哈。♫ ♫我帶着我的狗去散步，唱着我的歌，漫步着。♫ ♫是啊，我和我的狗沐浴着陽光，一切如此美好。♫ ♫我的生命寂寞而憂傷。♫ ♫是啊，我很不快樂。♫ ♫我也憤怒。♫ ♫然後你，在我陷入青春和恐懼時出現。♫ ♫我神經叮噹刺耳，苦艾酒和啤酒摧殘了我。♫ ♫但當我凝視你眼睛♫ ♫我不再失敗。♫ ♫你看上去古怪又精靈。♫ ♫我說：「天啊，我很開心，因為我帶着我的狗散步，♫ ♫沐浴着陽光，一切如此美好。」♫ ♫是啊，我和我的狗，唱着我們的歌，漫步着。♫ ♫因為我不關心你的仇恨和懷疑，♫ ♫我也不在乎政治家們的胡言亂語。♫ ♫如果你需要伴侶，為何不去狗場。♫ ♫為自己找一隻狗，讓那犬兒感到自豪，♫ ♫因爲就是這樣簡單的。♫ ♫(狗的喘息聲) 哈，哈，哈，哈，哈，哈，哈，哈。♫ ♫我的生命悲慘而哀傷，♫ ♫我是個典型的失敗者，♫ ♫我一塌糊塗，♫ ♫然後你，及時出現，搖搖你的尾巴♫ ♫可愛地扮演著坐監的牢犯。♫ ♫我說「汪汪，跟我來吧！」你叫了一聲，然後♫ ♫我不再孤單。♫ ♫我也不再爛醉。♫ ♫我們要建立一個最快樂的家園。♫ ♫我說：「天啊，我很開心，因為我帶着我的狗散步，♫ ♫唱着我的歌，漫步着。」♫ ♫是啊，我和我的狗沐浴着陽光，一切如此美好。♫ ♫因為我不關心你的仇恨和懷疑，♫ ♫我也不在乎政治家們的胡言亂語。♫ ♫如果你需要伴侶，為何不去狗場。♫ ♫為自己找一隻狗，讓那犬兒感到自豪，♫ ♫因爲就是這樣簡單的。♫ ♫就是這樣簡單的。♫ ♫就是這樣簡單的。♫ ♫就是這樣簡單的。♫♫ ♫(狗的喘息聲) 哈，哈，哈，哈。♫ 乖狗兒！ 多謝。
