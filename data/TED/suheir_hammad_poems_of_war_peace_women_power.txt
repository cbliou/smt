I know that beat. It is lifeless. I know intimately that skin you are hitting. It was alive once, hunted, stolen, stretched. I will not dance to your drummed-up war. I will not pop, spin, break for you. I will not hate for you or even hate you. I will not kill for you. Especially I will not die for you. I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide. I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing. Everyone can be wrong. Life is a right, not collateral or casual. I will not forget where I come from. I will craft my own drum. Gather my beloved near, and our chanting will be dancing. Our humming will be drumming. I will not be played. I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat. I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance. This heartbeat is louder than death. Your war drum ain't louder than this breath. Haaa. What's up TED people? Let me hear you make some noise. (Applause) A bunch of pacifists. Confused, aspiring pacifists. I understand. I've been wrong a lot lately. Like a lot. So I couldn't figure out what to read today. I mean, I've been saying I've been prepping. What that means is prepping my outfit, (Laughter) prepping options, trying to figure out what I'm coming behind and going in front of. Poetry does that. It preps you. It aims you. So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now. But I'm going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here. Hold her now with you. You don't need to say her name out loud, you can just hold her. Are you holding her? This is ""Break Clustered."" All holy history banned. Unwritten books predicted the future, projected the past. But my head unwraps around what appears limitless, man's creative violence. Whose son shall it be? Which male child will perish a new day? Our boys' deaths galvanize. We cherish corpses. We mourn women, complicated. Bitches get beat daily. Profits made, prophets ignored. War and tooth, enameled salted lemon childhoods. All colors run, none of us solid. Don't look for shadow behind me. I carry it within. I live cycles of light and darkness. Rhythm is half silence. I see now, I never was one and not the other. Sickness, health, tender violence. I think now I never was pure. Before form I was storm, blind, ign'ant — still am. Human contracted itself blind, malignant. I never was pure. Girl spoiled before ripened. Language can't math me. I experience exponentially. Everything is everything. One woman loses 15, maybe 20, members of her family. One woman loses six. One woman loses her head. One woman searches rubble. One woman feeds on trash. One woman shoots her face. One woman shoots her husband. One woman straps herself. One woman gives birth to a baby. One woman gives birth to borders. One woman no longer believes love will ever find her. One woman never did. Where do refugee hearts go? Broken, dissed, placed where they're not from, don't want to be missed. Faced with absence. We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all. My spine curves spiral. Precipice running to and running from human beings. Cluster bombs left behind. De facto landmines. A smoldering grief. Harvest contaminated tobacco. Harvest bombs. Harvest baby teeth. Harvest palms, smoke. Harvest witness, smoke. Resolutions, smoke. Salvation, smoke. Redemption, smoke. Breathe. Do not fear what has blown up. If you must, fear the unexploded. Thank you. (Applause)"	“我要的” 我不會隨你的戰鼓起舞我不會出借我的靈魂身骨給你的戰鼓。我不會隨著那節奏翩翩起舞我很清楚那節奏。沒有生命的節奏。我内心清楚你敲擊的那張皮從前是活著的而被獵殺、被竊取被綳緊。鼓聲隆隆的戰爭，我不會隨之起舞我不會爲了你躍進、迴旋或崩壞我不會為你而恨也不會恨你。我不會為你殺戮我更不會為你而死。我不會自殺，不會跟兇手一起悼念死者我不會支持你也不會隨炸彈起舞只是因爲每個人都在跳舞。每個人都會錯。生命是權利，不是附屬品或臨時的收容。我不會忘記我來自何方。我會打造我自己的鼓和我愛的人在一起我們的歌頌是我們的舞我們的低吟是我們的鼓沒有人可以主宰我你的戰鼓下不會包含我的名字和節奏。我會起舞、抗拒、起舞、繼續、再起舞。我的心跳比死亡還要響亮你的戰鼓還比不過這個呼吸聲。哈... TED的人們，怎麽了？讓我聼聼你的反應 （掌聲） 一票和平主義者困惑的抱有大志的和平主義者我懂。 最近以來我作錯很多像很多。所以我無法理出今天要讀些什麽。我是說，我一直說我在預習那是在說預習我的外觀（笑聲）預習選項試著去理清我離開了什麽將要面對什麽。詩可以讓人做好準備。讓人找到目標。 所以接下來我要讀一首詩一首剛剛選的詩但是我會需要你好好的坐10分鐘抱著一個不在這裡的女人現在就抱她靠緊你。你不需要說出她的名字，只需抱著她。你在抱她嗎？ 這是“打破集束（炸彈）“ 所有神聖的歷史都禁止。不成文的書預測了未來，影射了過去然而我的頭打開了那看起來永無止境人們富創意的暴力。那是誰的兒子？誰家的男孩在這新的一天要死亡？為我們孩子們的死亡鍍銀我們珍惜屍體我們哀悼女人，複雜。壞女人天天被打先知被創造、被忽略戰爭和傷痛裝飾了鹹鹹檸檬般的童年所有的顔色失真，所有的我們脆弱不必在我身後找尋背影。我一直帶著。我活在光明和黑暗的周期節奏的一半是寂靜。我現在懂了，我從未是一個，也不是另一個。生病，健康，溫柔的暴力。我現在認爲我從未純潔。在成型以前我是風暴盲目、無知—如今仍是人們和盲目、惡意結夥我從未是純潔的女孩們在成熟前就被摧殘你無法用言語來計算我我經歷了對數平方的事一切是一切一個女人家裏死了15或20個人一個女人死了6個一個女人失去頭顱一個女人找尋碎石。一個女人撿食垃圾。一個女人開槍射自己的臉。一個女人射自己的丈夫。一個女人用皮帶捆綁自己一個女人生了一個小孩。一個女人畫出新界綫一個女人不再相信愛會再來一個女人從沒相信過愛。流亡者的心都到哪去了？碎了，分崩離析被放在不是故鄉的地方，不想被思念。面無表情的臉孔我們為彼此哀悼或者這根本不代表什麽。我的脊椎迴旋危境在人間忽隱忽現集束炸彈留下了現在的地雷暗自燃燒的悲傷。收集污染煙草收集炸彈收集嬰孩牙齒收集斷掌，煙霧收集證人，煙霧決議文，煙霧救世，煙霧償還，煙霧。吸氣別害怕已經爆炸的如果真的要的話那麽就害怕未爆炸的吧。 謝謝大家 （掌聲）
