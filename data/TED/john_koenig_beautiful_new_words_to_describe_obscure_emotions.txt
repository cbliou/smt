john_koenig_beautiful_new_words_to_describe_obscure_emotions	"Today I want to talk about the meaning of words, how we define them and how they, almost as revenge, define us. The English language is a magnificent sponge. I love the English language. I'm glad that I speak it. But for all that, it has a lot of holes. In Greek, there's a word, ""lachesism"" which is the hunger for disaster. You know, when you see a thunderstorm on the horizon and you just find yourself rooting for the storm. In Mandarin, they have a word ""yù yī"" — I'm not pronouncing that correctly — which means the longing to feel intensely again the way you did when you were a kid. In Polish, they have a word ""jouska"" which is the kind of hypothetical conversation that you compulsively play out in your head. And finally, in German, of course in German, they have a word called ""zielschmerz"" which is the dread of getting what you want. (Laughter) Finally fulfilling a lifelong dream. I'm German myself, so I know exactly what that feels like. Now, I'm not sure if I would use any of these words as I go about my day, but I'm really glad they exist. But the only reason they exist is because I made them up. I am the author of ""The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows,"" which I've been writing for the last seven years. And the whole mission of the project is to find holes in the language of emotion and try to fill them so that we have a way of talking about all those human peccadilloes and quirks of the human condition that we all feel but may not think to talk about because we don't have the words to do it. And about halfway through this project, I defined ""sonder,"" the idea that we all think of ourselves as the main character and everyone else is just extras. But in reality, we're all the main character, and you yourself are an extra in someone else's story. And so as soon as I published that, I got a lot of response from people saying, ""Thank you for giving voice to something I had felt all my life but there was no word for that."" So it made them feel less alone. That's the power of words, to make us feel less alone. And it was not long after that that I started to notice sonder being used earnestly in conversations online, and not long after I actually noticed it, I caught it next to me in an actual conversation in person. There is no stranger feeling than making up a word and then seeing it take on a mind of its own. I don't have a word for that yet, but I will. (Laughter) I'm working on it. I started to think about what makes words real, because a lot of people ask me, the most common thing I got from people is, ""Well, are these words made up? I don't really understand."" And I didn't really know what to tell them because once sonder started to take off, who am I to say what words are real and what aren't. And so I sort of felt like Steve Jobs, who described his epiphany as when he realized that most of us, as we go through the day, we just try to avoid bouncing against the walls too much and just sort of get on with things. But once you realize that people — that this world was built by people no smarter than you, then you can reach out and touch those walls and even put your hand through them and realize that you have the power to change it. And when people ask me, ""Are these words real?"" I had a variety of answers that I tried out. Some of them made sense. Some of them didn't. But one of them I tried out was, ""Well, a word is real if you want it to be real."" The way that this path is real because people wanted it to be there. (Laughter) It happens on college campuses all the time. It's called a ""desire path."" (Laughter) But then I decided, what people are really asking when they're asking if a word is real, they're really asking, ""Well, how many brains will this give me access to?"" Because I think that's a lot of how we look at language. A word is essentially a key that gets us into certain people's heads. And if it gets us into one brain, it's not really worth it, not really worth knowing. Two brains, eh, it depends on who it is. A million brains, OK, now we're talking. And so a real word is one that gets you access to as many brains as you can. That's what makes it worth knowing. Incidentally, the realest word of all by this measure is this. [O.K.] That's it. The realest word we have. That is the closest thing we have to a master key. That's the most commonly understood word in the world, no matter where you are. The problem with that is, no one seems to know what those two letters stand for. (Laughter) Which is kind of weird, right? I mean, it could be a misspelling of ""all correct,"" I guess, or ""old kinderhook."" No one really seems to know, but the fact that it doesn't matter says something about how we add meaning to words. The meaning is not in the words themselves. We're the ones that pour ourselves into it. And I think, when we're all searching for meaning in our lives, and searching for the meaning of life, I think words have something to do with that. And I think if you're looking for the meaning of something, the dictionary is a decent place to start. It brings a sense of order to a very chaotic universe. Our view of things is so limited that we have to come up with patterns and shorthands and try to figure out a way to interpret it and be able to get on with our day. We need words to contain us, to define ourselves. I think a lot of us feel boxed in by how we use these words. We forget that words are made up. It's not just my words. All words are made up, but not all of them mean something. We're all just sort of trapped in our own lexicons that don't necessarily correlate with people who aren't already like us, and so I think I feel us drifting apart a little more every year, the more seriously we take words. Because remember, words are not real. They don't have meaning. We do. And I'd like to leave you with a reading from one of my favorite philosophers, Bill Watterson, who created ""Calvin and Hobbes."" He said, ""Creating a life that reflects your values and satisfies your soul is a rare achievement. To invent your own life's meaning is not easy, but it is still allowed, and I think you'll be happier for the trouble."" Thank you. (Applause)"	今天我想說一說詞語的意義，說一說我們如何定義它們以及它們如何反過來定義了我們。 英語這門語言是座大熔爐。我喜愛英語，我也樂意說英語。但儘管如此，英語有許多缺陷。在希臘，有一個單詞叫「lanchesism」，意思是對災難的渴望。當你在遠處地平線看到狂風暴雨，你卻發現你在為狂風暴雨喝彩。中國普通話有一個詞叫「yù yī」——（玉衣，作者編造的字）我的發音不是很標準——意思是渴望再一次強烈感受到兒少時最初的感動。在波蘭語中，他們有一個單詞叫「jouska」，意思是在你腦海中被迫出現的假設性對話。最後，當然，在德語中，有一個詞叫做「zielschmerz」，意思是對你很想得到的東西感到敬畏。 （笑聲） 雖然你最後實現了夢想……我自己是德國人，所以我知道那是什麼樣的感覺。 我並不清楚我是否在日常生活中會使用這些單詞，但是我對這些單詞的存在而感到高興。但其實它們存在的原因是這些字都是我編造出來的。 我是「The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows」網站創始人，在過去七年中我一直在編寫這個字典。這個計劃的總體的目標是發現情感語言的漏洞，並且嘗試著將漏洞補上，如此我們就有了一種可以討論 人類種種過失與怪癖狀態的方法，而那種狀態我們經常都能感受到，但卻不知道該如何形容它，因為我們並沒有相對應的詞語去描繪當下的狀態。 在這個計劃的中途，我定義了一個詞「sonder」，意思是我們都認為我們自己是主角，其他人只是臨時演員。但是現實是，你認為自己是主角，可是你在別人的故事裡卻只是配角罷了。然後我一發布這個詞語的定義，我就收到了來自人們許多的回覆，說到「謝謝您給了我一生都感覺到，卻無法用單詞去表達的感覺下了定義。 」所以這使得他們不再那麼孤單。這就是詞語的魅力，使得我們也不那麼孤單。 不久之後，我開始注意到「sonder」這個詞被熱烈地用在網絡交流當中，就在我注意到這個之後沒過多久，我就發現這個詞用在我身邊人與人之間的對話當中了。沒有什麼感覺比整理出一個詞彙並且看著它被人們接受來的更加奇怪了。我還沒有一個詞語對這種感覺進行解釋，但是早晚我會的。 （笑聲） 我已經開始做這件事了。 我開始思考是什麼原因讓這些詞語成真，因為有許多人問我，人們經常提出的問題是：「那麼，這些詞語是編造的嗎？我真的不理解啊。」我真的不知道怎麼回答他們，因為當「sonder」這個詞開始流行時，我算老幾，能跟別人說哪些詞語是真的、哪些不是真的？而我覺得我有點像史蒂夫·喬布斯在形容他自己頓悟時所描寫道的，他意識到，大部分人在生活中都在試圖避免碰壁麻煩的事， 並且希望萬事都很順利。但，一旦你了解那些人——了解這個世界是由那些不比你聰明的人所建構成時，那麼你就可以跨過那道牆壁，甚至伸出手幫他們一把，並且意識到自己就是那個有能力改變這些麻煩的人。 當人們問我，「這些詞語是真的嗎？」我曾經有過許多的答案去試著回答這個問題。有一些答案說得通。有一些答案說不通。但是有一個答案是，「如果你認為它是真的，那它就會變真的。」這個道理（路）之所以會存在就是因為人們想要它存在。 （笑聲） 這一幕在大學校園裡經常發生。這叫做「渴望的小道」。 （笑聲） 但是之後我發現當他們問這個詞語是否真實存在時，他們其實在問的是，「那麼，通過這個詞語我能敞開多少人的心扉呢？ 」因為我覺得這就是我們看待語言作用的方式。詞語是一把可以開啟人們大腦、明白他人在想什麼的關鍵鑰匙。如果這把鑰匙只有一個人了解，那它就沒啥價值，也不值得去了解。如果兩個人了解的話，就要取決於是誰了。 如果是一百萬個人能了解的話，是的，我們的對話才有意義。因此一個真實存在的詞語能幫助你了解更多人。這就是了解詞語魅力的所在。 順帶一提，用這種判斷方式得出的最真實詞語是這個： 【O.K.】 就是這個。這就是我們最真實的詞語。這就是我們最熟悉、熟練的詞語。這就是世界上最簡單易懂的單詞，無論你來自哪裡。問題是，似乎沒有人知道這兩個單詞字母代表什麼意思。 （笑聲） 這有一點不可思議，不是嗎？我猜它可能是「all correct」的錯誤拼寫，或者是「old kinderhook」的錯誤拼寫。似乎沒有人真的知道答案，但這個無關緊要的事實說明了我們是如何給詞語賦予含義的。詞語的含義不在於詞語本身。而是在於那個賦予詞語意義的人。 並且我覺得，當我們都在尋找我們生命中的意義、尋找生活的意義時，我覺得詞語和我們尋找的東西有著千絲萬縷的關係。而且我覺得如果你在尋找某些東西的含義時，字典是一個開始尋找的好地方。字典為你打開了一扇通向混沌宇宙的門。我們對事物的了解真的很有限，以至於我們不得不想出用一些形態或者是速記的方式去嘗試尋找該詞語的解釋，如此才可以讓我們的每一天繼續下去。我們需要詞語來蘊含我們自己，來定義我們自己。 我認為我們當中的許多人都感覺被我們所用的詞語給束縛住了。我們忘記了這些詞語是被編造出來的。不光光是我用的詞語。所有的詞語都是編造出來的，但不是所有的詞語都含有意義的。我們只是都有點被困在自己的詞典裡，而我們的詞典與不同道人的詞典沒有必然的關係，因此讓我感覺到我們每一年越來越疏遠，我們對待詞語也越來越嚴肅認真。 但要記得，詞語不是真實的。它們沒有任何的意義。是我們賦予它意義。 最後我想與各位分享一段我最喜歡的其中一位哲學家他的一句名言，《凱文的幻虎世界》的作者，比爾·沃特森，他說，「創造一個能反映你價值並且能使你靈魂滿足的生活是一件了不起的成就。去創造你自己生活的意義不是一件簡單的事，但它仍值得你一試，並且我覺得，你會很開心自找過這種麻煩。 」 謝謝。 （掌聲）
