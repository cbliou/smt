A TED medley — a TEDley. ♫ It's nine o' clock on a Saturday ♫ ♫ The record store's closed for the night ♫ ♫ So I fire up the old iTunes music store ♫ ♫ And soon I am feelin' all right ♫ ♫ I know Steve Jobs can find me a melody ♫ ♫ With one dollar pricing that rocks ♫ ♫ I can type in the track and get album names back ♫ ♫ While still in my PJs and socks ♫ ♫ Sell us a song, you're the music man ♫ ♫ My iPod's still got 10 gigs to go ♫ ♫ Yes, we might prefer more compatibility ♫ ♫ But Steve likes to run the whole show ♫ ♫ I heard ""Desperate Housewives"" was great last night ♫ ♫ But I had a bad piece of cod ♫ ♫ As I threw up my meal, I thought, ""It's no big deal"" ♫ ♫ I'll watch it tonight on my 'Pod ♫ ♫ And now all of the networks are joining in ♫ ♫ Two bucks a show without ads ♫ ♫ It's a business those guys always wanted to try ♫ ♫ But only Steve Jobs had the 'nads ♫ ♫ They say we're young, don't watch TV ♫ ♫ They say the Internet is all we see ♫ ♫ But that's not true; they've got it wrong ♫ ♫ See, all our shows are just two minutes long ♫ ♫ Hey ♫ ♫ I got YouTube ♫ ♫ I got YouTube ♫ And now, ladies and gentlemen, a tribute to the Recording Industry Association of America — the RIAA! ♫ Young man, you were surfin' along ♫ ♫ And then, young man, you downloaded a song ♫ ♫ And then, dumb man, copied it to your 'Pod ♫ ♫ Then a phone call came to tell you ... ♫ ♫ You've just been sued by the R-I-A-A ♫ ♫ You've just been screwed by the R-I-A-A ♫ ♫ Their attorneys say you committed a crime ♫ ♫ And there'd better not be a next time ♫ ♫ They've lost their minds at the R-I-A-A ♫ ♫ Justice is blind at the R-I-A-A ♫ ♫ You're depriving the bands ♫ ♫ You are learning to steal ♫ ♫ You can't do whatever you feel ♫ ♫ CD sales have dropped every year ♫ ♫ They're not greedy, they're just quaking with fear ♫ ♫ Yes indeedy, what if their end is near ♫ ♫ And we download all our music ♫ ♫ Yeah, that would piss off the R-I-A-A ♫ ♫ No plastic discs from the R-I-A-A ♫ ♫ What a way to make friends ♫ ♫ It's a plan that can't fail ♫ ♫ All your customers off to jail ♫ ♫ Who'll be next for the R-I-A-A? ♫ ♫ What else is vexing the R-I-A-A? ♫ ♫ Maybe whistling a tune ♫ ♫ Maybe humming along ♫ ♫ Maybe mocking 'em in a song ♫"	各位先生，各位女士，網路上的電視與音樂歷史在三分鐘內完整呈現。一個 TED 旋律。一個「泰迪律」。 ♫ 一個星期六晚上的九點鐘 ♫ ♫ 唱片行已經打烊了 ♫ ♫ 所以我打開老梗的 iTunes 線上音樂商店 ♫ ♫ 很快的我的心情就變好了 ♫ ♫ 我知道史帝夫•喬布斯可以為我找到一首歌 ♫ ♫ 只要一美元卻超酷的歌 ♫ ♫ 只需鍵入曲目，我就可以知道專輯名稱 ♫ ♫ 而我仍穿著睡衣和溫暖的襪子 ♫ ♫ 音樂人呀～賣我們歌吧～ ♫ ♫ 我的 iPod 還有 10G 的空間 ♫ ♫ 是的，如果有更多相容性會更好 ♫ ♫ 但是史帝夫喜歡當老大 ♫ ♫ 我聽說昨晚的慾望師奶影集很棒 ♫ ♫ 但是我昨晚吃鱈魚排食物中毒了 ♫ ♫ 當我昨晚在吐的時候，心想：「這沒什麼大不了」 ♫ ♫ 我今天晚上在我的 iPod 上面看就好了 ♫ ♫ 現在所有電視網路的節目都可以收看 ♫ ♫ 一集兩美元還沒有廣告 ♫ ♫ 這是那些傢伙一直都想做的生意 ♫ ♫ 但是只有史帝夫•喬布斯夠屌 ♫ ♫ 他們說我們年輕人不看電視 ♫ ♫ 他們說網路就是我們的全部 ♫ ♫ 但這不是事實，他們全都搞錯了 ♫ ♫ 因為，我們看的節目都只有兩分鐘 ♫ ♫ 嘿 ♫ ♫ 我有 YouTube ♫ ♫ 我有 YouTube ♫ 現在，各位先生，各位女士...向美國唱片業工會致敬，有名的 RIAA! ♫ 年輕人，你獨自在上網 ♫ ♫ 然後，年輕人，你下載了一首歌 ♫ ♫ 然後，笨蛋，把它複製到你的 iPod 中 ♫ ♫ 然後你就接到了一通電話 ♫ ♫ 你剛剛被 R~I~A~A 告了 ♫ ♫ 你剛剛被 R~I~A~A 搞了 ♫ ♫ 他們的律師說你犯罪了 ♫ ♫ 最好別有下次 ♫ ♫ 在 R~I~A~A 他們都瘋了 ♫ ♫ 在 R~I~A~A 正義是盲目的 ♫ ♫ 你在掠奪樂團 ♫ ♫ 你正學會偷竊 ♫ ♫ 你不能隨心所欲 ♫ ♫ CD 銷售量逐年下降 ♫ ♫ 他們不貪心，他們只是怕得發抖 ♫ ♫ 是的，是真的，如果他們的末日近了 ♫ ♫ 然後我們可以任意下載他們的音樂 ♫ ♫ 是的，這會惹火了 R~I~A~A ♫ ♫ 再也沒有從 R~I~A~A 來的塑膠碟片了 ♫ ♫ 這真是一個交朋友的好方法 ♫ ♫ 絕不會失敗 ♫ ♫ 所有的客戶都進了監牢 ♫ ♫ R~I~A~A 下一個會找誰麻煩？ ♫ ♫ 什麼還會讓 R~I~A~A 傷腦筋？ ♫ ♫ 也許吹口哨？ ♫ ♫ 也許哼首歌？ ♫ ♫ 或許在歌裡嘲諷他們？ ♫
