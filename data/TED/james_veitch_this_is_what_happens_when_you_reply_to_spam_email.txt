james_veitch_this_is_what_happens_when_you_reply_to_spam_email	"A few years ago, I got one of those spam emails. And it managed to get through my spam filter. I'm not quite sure how, but it turned up in my inbox, and it was from a guy called Solomon Odonkoh. (Laughter) I know. (Laughter) It went like this: it said, ""Hello James Veitch, I have an interesting business proposal I want to share with you, Solomon."" Now, my hand was kind of hovering on the delete button, right? I was looking at my phone. I thought, I could just delete this. Or I could do what I think we've all always wanted to do. (Laughter) And I said, ""Solomon, Your email intrigues me."" (Laughter) (Applause) And the game was afoot. He said, ""Dear James Veitch, We shall be shipping Gold to you."" (Laughter) ""You will earn 10% of any gold you distributes."" (Laughter) So I knew I was dealing with a professional. (Laughter) I said, ""How much is it worth?"" He said, ""We will start with smaller quantity,"" — I was like, aww — and then he said, ""of 25 kgs. (Laughter) The worth should be about $2.5 million."" I said, ""Solomon, if we're going to do it, let's go big. (Applause) I can handle it. How much gold do you have?"" (Laughter) He said, ""It is not a matter of how much gold I have, what matters is your capability of handling. We can start with 50 kgs as trial shipment."" I said, ""50 kgs? There's no point doing this at all unless you're shipping at least a metric ton."" (Laughter) (Applause) He said, ""What do you do for a living?"" (Laughter) I said, ""I'm a hedge fund executive bank manager."" (Laughter) This isn't the first time I've shipped bullion, my friend, no no no. Then I started to panic. I was like, ""Where are you based?"" I don't know about you, but I think if we're going via the postal service, it ought to be signed for. That's a lot of gold."" He said, ""It will not be easy to convince my company to do larger quantity shipment."" I said, ""Solomon, I'm completely with you on this one. I'm putting together a visual for you to take into the board meeting. Hold tight."" (Laughter) This is what I sent Solomon. (Laughter) (Applause) I don't know if we have any statisticians in the house, but there's definitely something going on. (Laughter) I said, ""Solomon, attached to this email you'll find a helpful chart. I've had one of my assistants run the numbers. (Laughter) We're ready for shipping as much gold as possible."" There's always a moment where they try to tug your heartstrings, and this was it for Solomon. He said, ""I will be so much happy if the deal goes well, because I'm going to get a very good commission as well."" And I said, ""That's amazing, What are you going to spend your cut on?"" And he said, ""On RealEstate, what about you?"" I thought about it for a long time. And I said, ""One word; Hummus."" (Laughter) ""It's going places. (Laughter) I was in Sainsbury's the other day and there were like 30 different varieties. Also you can cut up carrots, and you can dip them. Have you ever done that, Solomon?"" (Laughter) He said, ""I have to go bed now."" (Laughter) (Applause) ""Till morrow. Have sweet dream."" I didn't know what to say! I said, ""Bonsoir my golden nugget, bonsoir."" (Laughter) Guys, you have to understand, this had been going for, like, weeks, albeit hitherto the greatest weeks of my life, but I had to knock it on the head. It was getting a bit out of hand. Friends were saying, ""James, do you want to come for a drink?"" I was like, ""I can't, I'm expecting an email about some gold."" So I figured I had to knock it on the head. I had to take it to a ridiculous conclusion. So I concocted a plan. I said, ""Solomon, I'm concerned about security. When we email each other, we need to use a code."" And he agreed. (Laughter) I said, ""Solomon, I spent all night coming up with this code we need to use in all further correspondence: Lawyer: Gummy Bear. Bank: Cream Egg. Legal: Fizzy Cola Bottle. Claim: Peanut M&Ms. Documents: Jelly Beans. Western Union: A Giant Gummy Lizard."" (Laughter) I knew these were all words they use, right? I said, ""Please call me Kitkat in all further correspondence."" (Laughter) I didn't hear back. I thought, I've gone too far. I've gone too far. So I had to backpedal a little. I said, ""Solomon, Is the deal still on? KitKat."" (Laughter) Because you have to be consistent. Then I did get an email back from him. He said, ""The Business is on and I am trying to blah blah blah ..."" I said, ""Dude, you have to use the code!"" What followed is the greatest email I've ever received. (Laughter) I'm not joking, this is what turned up in my inbox. This was a good day. ""The business is on. I am trying to raise the balance for the Gummy Bear — (Laughter) so he can submit all the needed Fizzy Cola Bottle Jelly Beans to the Creme Egg, for the Peanut M&Ms process to start. (Laughter) Send 1,500 pounds via a Giant Gummy Lizard."" (Applause) And that was so much fun, right, that it got me thinking: like, what would happen if I just spent as much time as could replying to as many scam emails as I could? And that's what I've been doing for three years on your behalf. (Laughter) (Applause) Crazy stuff happens when you start replying to scam emails. It's really difficult, and I highly recommend we do it. I don't think what I'm doing is mean. There are a lot of people who do mean things to scammers. All I'm doing is wasting their time. And I think any time they're spending with me is time they're not spending scamming vulnerable adults out of their savings, right? And if you're going to do this — and I highly recommend you do — get yourself a pseudonymous email address. Don't use your own email address. That's what I was doing at the start and it was a nightmare. I'd wake up in the morning and have a thousand emails about penis enlargements, only one of which was a legitimate response — (Laughter) to a medical question I had. But I'll tell you what, though, guys, I'll tell you what: any day is a good day, any day is a good day if you receive an email that begins like this: (Laughter) ""I AM WINNIE MANDELA, THE SECOND WIFE OF NELSON MANDELA THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT."" I was like, oh! — that Winnie Mandela. (Laughter) I know so many. ""I NEED TO TRANSFER 45 MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND NELSON MANDELA'S HEALTH CONDITION."" Let that sink in. She sent me this, which is hysterical. (Laughter) And this. And this looks fairly legitimate, this is a letter of authorization. But to be honest, if there's nothing written on it, it's just a shape! (Laughter) I said, ""Winnie, I'm really sorry to hear of this. Given that Nelson died three months ago, I'd describe his health condition as fairly serious."" (Laughter) That's the worst health condition you can have, not being alive. She said, ""KINDLY COMPLY WITH MY BANKERS INSTRUCTIONS. ONE LOVE."" (Laughter) I said, ""Of course. NO WOMAN, NO CRY."" (Laughter) (Applause) She said, ""MY BANKER WILL NEED TRANSFER OF 3000 DOLLARS. ONE LOVE."" (Laughter) I said, ""no problemo. I SHOT THE SHERIFF."" [ (BUT I DID NOT SHOOT THE DEPUTY) ] (Laughter) Thank you. (Applause)"	"幾年前，我收到一封垃圾郵件。它突破了我的垃圾郵件過濾器。我不太確定它怎麼辦到的，反正就是出現在我信箱，寄件人是一個叫「所羅門．沃當克」的傢伙。 （笑聲） 我知道， （笑聲） 內容如下：“ 哈囉，詹姆士．維奇，我想跟你合夥一筆有趣的生意企劃，所羅門　敬上 ""這時，我的手指應該已經停在刪除鍵準備刪掉，對吧？我看著我的手機，我在想，我可以就這樣把它刪掉。或者，我可以做些我認為大家一直都很想做的事。 （笑聲） 所以我說，"" 所羅門，你的來信讓我很感興趣"" （笑聲） （掌聲） 遊戲就此開始， 他說，"" 親愛的詹姆士．維奇，我們將會運黃金給你 "" （笑聲） "" 你賣掉可從中獲利 10％ "" （笑聲） 我知道，我遇上了一個 PRO 級的... （笑聲） 我說，"" 它價值多少錢?"" 他說，"" 我們可以先從小量開始 ""—我當下就 “蛤...”然後他說，"" 25公斤 "" （笑聲） "" 價值應該大約250萬美元 "" 我說，"" 所羅門，我們要幹就要幹大票的 "" （掌聲） "" 我能搞定，你有多少黃金?"" （笑聲） 他說，"" 這跟我有多少黃金無關 ，而跟你的能力有關，我們可以先從50公斤開始嘗試 "" 我說，"" 50公斤？這沒甚麼搞頭啊 ...除非 ...你至少運個 1公噸來啊..."" （笑聲） （掌聲） 他說，"" 你甚麼職業來的?"" （笑聲） 我說，"" 我是避險基金的銀行操盤經理 "" （笑聲） 冰友啊，這又不是我第一次運送金條不、不、不 ... 然後我開始假裝慌了，我說，"" 你們公司在哪? ""我不認識你，但我認為如果我們要透過郵寄服務，它應該是要能被簽收的吧，這會有很多黃金"" 他說，"" 要說服公司運輸大筆交易，不容易 "" 我說，"" 所羅門，我完全同意你這一點，我等一下傳個圖表給你，讓你在董事會議上說明等我一下... "" （笑聲） 這就是我傳給所羅門的... （笑聲）【橫軸：財富，縱軸：金條數量】 （掌聲） 我不確定我們這裡是否有統計學家，但一定是有事發生就對了。 （笑聲） 我說，"" 所羅門，你可以在附件裡找到一張對你有幫助的圖表。我請我的助理分析了數據一下。 （笑聲） 我們已準備好盡可能多運一些黃金 "" 人總是有被吸引得心癢癢的時候，而所羅門正處在這種狀態。他說，“如果真的成交，我會非常開心，因為我也可以得到很多的傭金""我說，"" 太棒了，你想要怎麼用那筆錢？""他說，"" 不動產，你呢？"" 我想了很久...然後我說，"" 就一個東西 ;鹰嘴豆沙 "" （笑聲） "" 這肯定成功的啦！“ （笑聲） 我改天會在Sainsbury's（英國第二大超市連鎖店）那裏有30種不同的口味 ...你還可以切些紅蘿蔔，沾一點鹰嘴豆沙來吃呢。你有試過嗎，所羅門？ "" （笑聲） 他說，"" 我得睡覺了 "" （笑聲） （掌聲） "" 明天見！祝你好夢！ "" 我當下不知道該說甚麼了！我說，""晚安，我的金條，晚安 "" （笑聲） 各位，你必須了解，這持續了...好幾個禮拜，雖然到目前為止，這是我生命中最棒的幾個禮拜，但我不想繼續下去了，它有點失控了。朋友問我，""詹姆士，你要來喝一杯嗎？ ""我說，"" 我不行，我在等一個有關黃金的電郵 "" 所以，我在想我得停止了，我必須讓這場戲有個荒謬的結局我於是想出了一個辦法，我說，""所羅門，我很擔心安全問題，當我們互相通信時，我們需要用暗號 ""他同意了。 （笑聲） 我說，"" 所羅門，我花了一整晚，想到了這些暗號接下來的所有通信，我們要用這些暗號 ： 律師：橡皮熊， 銀行：奶油蛋， 法律：可樂瓶糖果，主張聲明：M&M巧克力 文件：果凍糖西聯匯款公司：巨型橡皮蜥蜴 "" （笑聲） 我知道，這些都是他們在用的字，對吧？我說，"" 接下來的通信，請稱呼我 Kitkat ""( 巧克力棒品牌 ) （笑聲） 我看不到回應，我在想，我可能過頭了...所以，我必須回頭一點點，我說，"" 所羅門，我們的交易還在進行嗎？Kitkat 敬上 "" （笑聲） 因為你必須堅持。然後，我真的收到了他的回信，他說，"" 交易是還有的，我正在...叭喇叭喇叭喇...
