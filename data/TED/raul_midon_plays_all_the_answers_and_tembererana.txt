raul_midon_plays_all_the_answers_and_tembererana	"(Applause) It's really quite an honor to be here tonight, and I'm really glad that I stayed here and listened because I've really been inspired. And I'm going to play some songs for you tonight that are, literally, world premieres. I've been working on my new record and I've never played these songs for anybody except the microphone. This is a song that I wrote about the meaning of technology, which goes perfectly with this gathering. I started thinking about — when I was in college, especially as a blind person, doing a research paper was a major undertaking. You had to go to the library, see if you could get them to find the books for you, you know, footnotes and all that. Now you can just go on Google. Just look it up. I wish I had that when I was in college. Anyway, this is a song about: we have all this, but what are we going to do with it? It's called ""All the Answers."" ♫ What is the weather in Cincinnati? ♫ ♫ What is the time in Tokyo? ♫ ♫ Who is this little child's daddy? ♫ ♫ And who the hell needs to know? ♫ ♫ Why do memories of you linger ♫ ♫ when I'm trying to reach my goal? ♫ ♫ And why must I move my fingers ♫ ♫ to the music in my soul? ♫ ♫ I don't know. ♫ ♫ I don't have to know. ♫ ♫ 'Cause here I go ... ♫ ♫ and I got all the answers ♫ ♫ right here in my hand. ♫ ♫ And I got all the answers ♫ ♫ and I don't have to understand ♫ ♫ 'cause I got all the answers. ♫ ♫ Think I'll rummage through the century ♫ ♫ while I listen to the sea. ♫ ♫ Oh, it's good to be so free, ♫ ♫ so free. ♫ ♫ Who was mayor of Chicago ♫ ♫ back in 1964? ♫ ♫ And why did Shakespeare create Iago ♫ ♫ to tear apart a love so pure? ♫ ♫ How can my dreams be so vivid ♫ ♫ in a psychosonic way? ♫ ♫ Why must I become so livid ♫ ♫ about the news I hear today? ♫ ♫ I don't know. ♫ ♫ I don't have to know. ♫ ♫ And here I go ... ♫ ♫ 'cause I got all the answers ♫ ♫ right here in my hand. ♫ ♫ And I got all the answers. ♫ ♫ See, I don't have to understand ♫ ♫ 'cause I got all the answers. ♫ ♫ I think I'll browse on through ♫ ♫ the tabloid news ♫ ♫ while I sip my tea. ♫ ♫ Mm, it's good to be so free. ♫ (Trumpet sounds) ♫ I never ever have to be alone. ♫ ♫ I can do it all right here in my home. ♫ ♫ Yeah, mm-hmm ... ♫ ♫ Everything that's ever been known, ♫ ♫ I can punch it up right here on my phone. ♫ ♫ Freedom train, coming soon ♫ ♫ right here in my living room ♫ ♫ from Baton Rouge to Saskatoon ♫ ♫ and all points in between. ♫ ♫ 'Cause I got all the answers ♫ ♫ right here on my screen. ♫ ♫ And I got all the answers, yeah. ♫ ♫ I got every book and magazine. ♫ ♫ I got all, I got all, I got all ... ♫ ♫ I got all the answers, ♫ ♫ all the answers, oh yeah. ♫ ♫ Uh-huh ... ♫ ♫ But I tell you what I'm going to do: ♫ ♫ I'm going to find the capitol of Peru ♫ ♫ or the latitude of Kathmandu. ♫ ♫ I'm gonna Google it ♫ ♫ 'cause everybody's doing it. ♫ ♫ And then I'll rummage through the century. ♫ ♫ I got all, I got all, I got all ... ♫ ♫ I got all the answers. ♫ ♫ Yeah, yeah ♫ ♫ I got all the answers. ♫ (Applause) Thank you. Whew! It's a miracle I didn't make any mistakes on that song. That's the first time I've ever played it. (Applause) It's a ""feel the fear and do it anyway"" kind of thing. This next song is a song that started out as a dream — a childhood dream. It was one of the titles that I was sort of thinking about calling my record, except there's a couple of problems. One thing is, it's unpronounceable. And it's a made-up word. It's called ""Tembererana."" And the song is based on what I think was my first childhood attempts to think about invisible forces. So ""tembererana"" was these dreams, in which I would be running away from bad feelings — is the only way I can put it. So this is called ""Tembererana."" It's based on an Argentinian rhythm called ""carnivalito."" ♫ A dream within a dream, ♫ ♫ a world within a world, ♫ ♫ the sound of a primal scream ♫ ♫ travels out across the land. ♫ ♫ Images flickering, ♫ ♫ the sound of the war machine, ♫ ♫ a procession of limousines ♫ ♫ travels slowly across the land. ♫ ♫ Another child could use a hand. ♫ ♫ Reaching out from within ♫ ♫ tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫ ♫ Annihilation moves. ♫ ♫ The earth is an open tomb. ♫ ♫ The sound of the final boom ♫ ♫ rumbles fiercely across the land. ♫ ♫ Fear, you're the enemy. ♫ ♫ Obliterating all but thee. ♫ ♫ You see what you want to see. ♫ ♫ Before I'm blinded, I will toast ♫ ♫ the shade of power that I love most, ♫ ♫ the power of creation. ♫ ♫ Tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫ ♫ Da, da, da, da ♫ ♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da ♫ ♫ As a child, alone and afraid, ♫ ♫ escaping the impressions every feeling made, ♫ ♫ I would run, run away ♫ ♫ into a world where the good was the aim of the game ♫ ♫ and the sum of invisible power ♫ ♫ had a name. ♫ ♫ It's the same name. ♫ ♫ Tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫ ♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da ♫ ♫ Tembere, tembere, tembere, tembererana ♫ ♫ Tembere, tembere, tembere, tembererana, hey ♫ ♫ Tembererana, hey ♫ ♫ Tembererana ... ♫ (Applause)"	(觀眾掌聲) 今夜能在這裏演唱真是榮幸，我很高興自己待在這裏聆聽，因為我真的受到了不小的啟迪。今夜我將為你們演奏一些曲子，這真的是我的首次世界公演。我一直在為我的新唱片付出努力還沒有為任何人演唱過這些歌曲除了我的麥克風。 我寫的這首歌是關於科技的意義，和這次會議的目的完美結合。我開始想起我在大學的時光，尤其是作為一個盲人學生，做一份學術論文是一個重要的任務。你得去圖書館，看看你能不能麻煩別人幫你找到你要的書籍，你知道的，還要做註腳等等。現在你只需要上谷歌，點下搜尋。如果我那時候有谷歌就好了。不論怎樣，這首歌是關於—我們擁有這些科技，但應該怎樣應用它們？歌名是“所有的答案”。 ♫辛辛那提的天氣怎樣？♫ ♫東京現在幾點了？♫ 這個小娃娃的爹爹是誰？♫ ♫誰又需要知道這些？♫ ♫為什麼你的記憶纏綿徘徊♫ ♫當我努力朝目標前進？♫ ♫為什麼我還需要移動我的手指？♫ ♫當我已與音樂融為一體?♫ ♫我不了解♫ ♫我不需要懂♫ ♫因為在這裏♫ ♫我擁有所有的答案♫ ♫盡在我身畔♫ ♫我有了所有的答案♫ ♫我不需要再讓心思亂轉♫ ♫因為我有了所有答案♫ ♫我想我會漫遊所有時光♫ ♫當我聽著海濱之音在沙灘上漫步♫ ♫哦，自由是那樣美好♫ ♫我是那樣地自由♫ ♫誰是芝加哥市長♫ ♫在1964那個年度？♫ ♫為什麼莎士比亞創造了伊阿古♫ ♫將如此純潔的愛情變成一場事故？♫ ♫ 我的夢怎麼會這樣栩栩如生♫ ♫ 仿佛心裏充滿美妙的音樂？♫ ♫ 我為什麼一定要變得那樣栩栩如生♫ ♫ 關於我今天發生的新的故事？♫ ♫我不了解♫ ♫我不需要懂♫ ♫因為在這裏♫ ♫因為所有的答案♫ ♫盡在我的身畔♫ ♫我有所有的答案♫ ♫看，我不需要懂♫ ♫因為我有所有的答案♫ ♫我想我會去流覽♫ ♫小報上的新聞♫ ♫當我品著好茶♫ ♫嗯，這樣的自由真好♫ (喇叭聲) ♫我從不會被迫孤獨♫ ♫我可以在我的房間裏做一切的事♫ ♫耶，嗯哼...♫ ♫所有的已知的事♫ ♫我都可以把它敲進我的手機♫ ♫自由的火車，它就要駛來♫ ♫駛向我的起居室♫ ♫從巴頓魯治到薩斯卡通♫ ♫以及中間所有的連接點♫ ♫因為所有的答案♫ ♫就在我的螢幕之上♫ ♫ 所有的答案，耶♫ ♫ 我有每一本書和雜誌♫ ♫ 我有所有的，一切的，一切的...♫ ♫ 一切事情的答案♫ ♫ 所有的答案，哦耶♫ ♫ 啊哈...♫ ♫ 但讓我告訴你我將要做什麼♫ ♫ 我要去尋找秘魯的首都♫ ♫ 或者加德滿都的維度♫ ♫ 我要谷歌一下♫ ♫ 因為每個人都愛用谷歌♫ ♫ 然後我要搜遍整個時光♫ ♫ 我有所有的，一切的，一切的...♫ ♫ 一切事情的答案♫ ♫耶，耶♫ ♫我有所有的答案♫ (觀眾掌聲) 謝謝呼！這首歌我一點錯都沒犯，真是個奇跡。這是我第一次演奏它。(觀眾掌聲)這是種“感到恐懼但是還是迎頭而上”的事。接下來這首歌 來自一個夢境 —- 一個兒時的夢。它的歌名是我設想裏的專輯名之一除了有幾個問題一個是它很難發音。並且它是個造出來的詞。它叫“彈撥若然娜”。這首歌的基礎我覺得是我的第一次兒時的嘗試去思索看不見的力量。所以“彈撥若然娜”就是這些夢境在夢中，我想從壞情緒中逃走 — 我只能這樣去表達它。所以這就是我的“彈撥若然娜”。它以一個阿根廷韻調為基礎一個小型嘉年華的韻調。 ♫夢境裏的夢境♫ ♫世界中的世界♫ ♫原始的尖叫呻吟♫ ♫跨越整片大地♫ ♫閃爍搖曳的影像♫ ♫戰爭機器發出的聲音♫ ♫豪華轎車不停前行♫ ♫緩緩遊遍整片大地♫ ♫另一個孩童用手可以♫ ♫叢裏向外觸摸過去♫ ♫彈撥若然娜，嘿，彈撥若然娜...♫ ♫殲滅正在發生♫ ♫大地就是大開的墳墓♫ ♫最後的隆隆聲音♫ ♫隆隆聲猛烈地遊遍整片大地♫ ♫恐懼，你是我們的仇敵♫ ♫毀滅一切，除了自己♫ ♫你看見想要看見的東西♫ ♫在我失明前我將舉杯歡慶♫ ♫向我最愛的力量的陰影♫ ♫創造的權力♫ ♫彈撥若然娜，嘿，彈撥若然娜...♫ ♫噠，噠，噠，噠♫ ♫噠，噠，噠，噠，噠，噠，噠♫ ♫當我是個孩子時，我孤獨又恐懼♫ ♫對一切感情的印象只想逃離♫ ♫我會逃離，逃離♫ ♫逃向一個世界，那裏的良善就是遊戲的意義♫ ♫看不見的力量加在一起♫ ♫有一個名字♫ ♫還是這個名字...♫ ♫彈撥若然娜，嘿，彈撥若然娜...♫ ♫ 噠，噠，噠，噠，噠，噠，噠♫ ♫ 彈撥，彈撥，彈撥，彈撥若然娜♫ ♫ 彈撥，彈撥，彈撥，彈撥若然娜，嘿♫ ♫ 彈撥若然娜，嘿♫ ♫ 彈撥若然娜......♫ (觀眾掌聲)
